In the heart of Mount Isa, a vibrant mining town in northwest Queensland, Abby stands as a beacon of hope in the fight against Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD). As a clinical nurse specializing in RHD care, Abby's work is more than just a job—it's a mission to improve the lives of those affected by this preventable yet devastating condition.

Abby, who has been in Mount Isa for about a year, brings a fresh perspective to the RHD team. Her role involves working directly in the community with RHD clients, providing holistic care that goes beyond just medical treatment. ""We go and visit them, make sure they're up to date with all of their RHD cares. We see new clients and it's a holistic approach to their disease,"" Abby explains.

RHD, as Abby describes, is a heart disease that affects the valves of the heart, creating permanent scarring. It's a condition that disproportionately affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, making it a significant health concern in communities like Mount Isa.

The challenges in managing RHD in Mount Isa are multifaceted. ""We have lots of issues with housing and poverty particularly in the northwest unfortunately,"" Abby notes. These social determinants of health play a crucial role in the prevalence and management of RHD. Additionally, the rural and remote nature of the area poses its own set of challenges. ""Access being rural and remote accessing the cares can be difficult for our clients,"" she adds.

To combat these challenges, Abby and her team take a proactive approach. They focus on providing direct care in the community rather than relying on clients to come to clinics. This strategy helps break down barriers to access and ensures that clients receive the care they need.

Education is another crucial component of their work. With a high turnover of staff in the area, many clinicians arrive with little to no knowledge of RHD. Abby and her team work tirelessly to educate healthcare professionals and community members alike about the disease, its prevention, and management.

Prevention is key in the fight against RHD, and this is where community collaboration becomes vital. Abby emphasizes the importance of services that help maintain good hygiene, such as Orange Sky's laundry services. ""If we can have things that can help or if we have services like Orange Sky that can come in and help clients with that then we are kind of killing the disease at the start rather than clients getting the disease and then treating on from there,"" she explains.

Looking to the future, Abby's vision extends beyond just managing RHD. She recognizes that addressing the root causes of the disease is crucial. ""Fixing rheumatic heart disease is not the problem that we should be focusing on. I mean it's more so like of your social issues that is the primary problem,"" she reflects. Her hope is to see improvements in housing, access to healthcare, and other social determinants of health that contribute to the prevalence of RHD.

Abby's work in Mount Isa is a powerful reminder of the importance of community-based healthcare and the impact that dedicated healthcare professionals can have. Her holistic approach, focusing not just on treatment but on prevention and education, offers hope for a future where RHD no longer poses such a significant threat to the community.

As we look at the broader picture of health in rural and remote Australia, stories like Abby's highlight the unique challenges these communities face and the innovative approaches being taken to address them. It's a testament to the resilience of these communities and the dedication of healthcare workers like Abby who are working tirelessly to make a difference.

In the end, Abby's mission in Mount Isa is about more than just treating a disease—it's about building a healthier, more resilient community. It's a mission that reminds us all of the power of compassion, education, and community collaboration in tackling even the most challenging health issues.","RHD,Prevention,Community,Collaboration,Hygiene,Education","Abby, a clinical nurse, has been working in Mount Isa for about a year, focusing on community care for clients with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD).

In the bustling streets of Perth, AJ Bailey's story stands as a powerful testament to the transformative impact of Orange Sky. From being a service user to becoming a dedicated team leader, AJ's journey embodies the organization's mission of fostering connection, restoring dignity, and changing lives.

Nine years ago, AJ found himself staying at St. Pat's, experiencing homelessness and struggling to make ends meet. It was during this challenging time that he first encountered Orange Sky's mobile laundry service. ""I used Orange Sky for two weeks,"" AJ recalls. ""And I loved it, I loved the service.""

Inspired by the kindness and support he received, AJ took a leap of faith. He approached Helen, the team leader at the time, and asked if he could join the team. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of AJ's remarkable journey with Orange Sky.

Over the years, AJ worked his way up through the ranks, transitioning from a general volunteer to an assistant team leader, and finally to his current role as a team leader. Now, he volunteers on two shifts per week, one in Perth on Sundays and another at Gosnells on Wednesdays.

AJ's passion for the work is palpable. ""I love giving it back to the community,"" he says with enthusiasm. His unique perspective as someone who has experienced homelessness firsthand adds depth and empathy to his interactions with Orange Sky's friends. ""I feel good inside... Because I know what it's like because I've been on the street myself and I see both sides of the fence.""

This dual perspective allows AJ to connect with Orange Sky's friends on a profound level. He understands their struggles, their needs, and the immense impact that a simple act of kindness can have. ""I see people's faces with a big smile on their face,"" AJ shares, describing the joy he witnesses when people receive clean, dry clothes.

But for AJ, Orange Sky is about more than just providing clean laundry. It's about creating a sense of community, offering support, and being there for people in their moments of need. He recounts a particularly poignant experience where he helped prevent a suicide attempt, illustrating the life-changing impact that Orange Sky volunteers can have.

AJ's commitment to the cause extends beyond his volunteer shifts. He's passionate about expanding Orange Sky's services and resources to help more people in need. ""I reckon Basil should pull his finger out his arse, spend money on accommodation for the homeless,"" he says candidly, advocating for more support from local government.

His dream is to see Orange Sky expand its capacity, adding more washing machines and dryers to serve the growing number of friends who rely on the service. ""Every week I have between eight to ten friends come down. I don't like knocking them back,"" AJ explains, highlighting the ongoing need in the community.

For those considering supporting Orange Sky, AJ's message is clear and heartfelt. ""Orange Sky is a really good service. We put clean clothes, showers, we supply showers... And to me it feels... I feel good inside. Yeah. Because I know what it's like because I've been on the street myself and I see both sides of the fence.""

AJ Bailey's journey from homelessness to becoming a key member of the Orange Sky team is a powerful reminder of the organization's impact. It shows that with the right support and opportunities, people can not only overcome their own challenges but also become instrumental in helping others.

As Orange Sky continues to grow and touch more lives, stories like AJ's serve as an inspiration and a call to action. They remind us of the power of community, the importance of second chances, and the profound impact that a simple act of kindness can have on a person's life.

AJ's story is more than just a success story - it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of compassion and community support. It embodies the very essence of what Orange Sky strives to achieve: not just providing a service, but building a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.","Homelessness,Transformation,Volunteering,Community,Empathy,Support",AJ Bailey shares his journey from being homeless to becoming a team leader at Orange Sky.,89

In the heart of the Central Coast, a remarkable story of transformation unfolds. Amanda Mundell, once struggling with homelessness and battling mental health issues, now stands as a beacon of hope for her community. Her journey from a service user to a volunteer at Orange Sky exemplifies the power of resilience, community support, and the human spirit.

Amanda's story begins in a place of darkness. As a single mother raising two daughters, she faced numerous challenges including homelessness, mental health struggles, and the aftermath of domestic violence. ""I've been through some pretty dark times,"" Amanda recalls. The weight of her circumstances was overwhelming, leading her to a point where hope seemed lost.

However, Amanda's life took a turn when she was approved for an NDIS plan for her mental health. This pivotal moment provided her with crucial wraparound supports, including psychology services and community engagement activities. These resources played a vital role in helping Amanda regain her mental footing and set the stage for her remarkable comeback.

Taking a leap of faith, Amanda applied for a cadetship with Pacific Link Housing. This decision marked the beginning of her professional transformation. She studied full-time, earned her Certificate IV in Housing, and now works as a tenancy manager. In this role, she assists people who are in situations similar to what she once experienced, bringing a unique level of empathy and understanding to her work.

Amanda's connection with Orange Sky, a free mobile laundry service for people experiencing homelessness, began when she was a service user. She vividly remembers the impact of the volunteers' kindness during those difficult times. ""I felt really embarrassed,"" she admits, reflecting on her initial visits. ""But he just spoke to me the whole time I was here, and he was so kind and so caring, and he didn't judge me for the situation I was in.""

This experience left such a profound impression on Amanda that once she secured a job and housing, she made the decision to volunteer with Orange Sky. Her transition from service user to volunteer is a testament to her resilience and desire to give back to the community that supported her.

As a volunteer, Amanda brings a unique perspective to her role. She understands firsthand the challenges faced by those using the service and the immense impact a simple conversation can have. ""You really do feel invisible when you're struggling,"" she explains. ""To just sit here for a whole hour and be treated like I mattered, that meant so much, and that's how I wanted to make other people feel.""

Amanda's story highlights the often hidden nature of struggle within communities. She emphasizes that many people experiencing hardship may not be visible, as it takes courage to seek help. Her experiences have given her insight into the complex issues facing her community, including homelessness, lack of affordable housing, domestic violence, and mental health challenges.

Looking to the future, Amanda continues to find ways to make a positive impact. She's becoming a spokesperson for the Good Box, an initiative providing essential items to those in need. Her goal is to raise awareness about the significant impact small acts of kindness can have on people's lives.

Amanda's journey is a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of community support. Her story inspires hope and demonstrates that with the right support and determination, it's possible to overcome even the most challenging circumstances.","Resilience,Transformation,Empathy,Volunteering,Purpose,Connection","Amanda Mundell, a single mother who overcame homelessness, mental health issues, and domestic violence, now works as a tenancy manager helping others.",150

In the heart of the Goldfields region, where the red earth meets the vast blue sky, Anna King of Bega Garnbirringu Health Service is witnessing a transformation. As the Health Programs Coordinator, Anna has a front-row seat to the impact that Orange Sky is making in Kalgoorlie and its surrounding communities.

Anna's journey with Bega spans 16 years, during which she's seen the organization evolve to meet the complex needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families in the Goldfields. ""Bega is an Aboriginal health service that caters to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families throughout the Goldfields,"" Anna explains. ""We not only do clinical services, but we also have a wide range of services that tap into social and emotional wellbeing, social support services for homeless, fringe dwellers.""

It's within this holistic approach to health and wellbeing that Orange Sky found its place. When the mobile laundry service first rolled into town, there was a mix of excitement and uncertainty. ""Community heard about Orange Sky coming, so it sort of had this trickle effect into community where they were excited about it coming,"" Anna recalls. ""They weren't too sure how it was going to look, and then when they heard that Bega was taking that on, they got excited to see what it would happen and do for community.""

The impact was almost immediate and profoundly touching. Anna shares a powerful observation: ""They said that everyone, you could see the confidence in people walking around the streets. Whereas before, people didn't, who weren't able to have showers, who weren't able to have clean clothes, they would slump. They wouldn't look up, you know. Whereas now they're out and about in town. They look as happy as they can be, you know. It's almost like giving them a new sense of life.""

This transformation goes beyond clean clothes. It's about dignity, self-respect, and the power of human connection. Anna emphasizes the importance of these connections: ""If you can make a connection with a person, you can make their day, you know. You don't know where they've come from or what sort of night they've had, whether they've even eaten. But to say hello to somebody, to actually ask about their day, to generally find out about them, it's not hard to do. And it doesn't cost much. But it can mean so much to that person.""

The success of Orange Sky in Kalgoorlie has been remarkable. What started as a service providing about 22 loads of laundry has now grown to an average of 50 loads. This growth is a testament to the need in the community and the trust that Orange Sky has built.

Looking to the future, Anna sees potential for expansion. ""I can actually see that Orange Sky could start branching out within the Goldfields region,"" she says. ""I definitely know Laverton, you know, is in need and would love some type of service up there.""

What's particularly striking about Anna's perspective is her belief in the Orange Sky concept beyond just the mobile laundry service. ""I think regardless of what they do, whether it's a truck, whether it's a building, I don't think things would change so much. I think the Orange Sky, however it is put into community, will flourish.""

This adaptability and the organization's commitment to meeting community needs wherever they are is what makes Orange Sky so impactful. It's not just about laundry; it's about creating a space for connection, dignity, and hope.

As we reflect on Anna's insights, we're reminded of the profound impact that seemingly simple services can have on a community. Orange Sky, through its laundry services and the connections it fosters, is not just cleaning clothes – it's helping to rebuild lives, restore dignity, and strengthen communities.

In Kalgoorlie and beyond, Orange Sky continues to be a beacon of hope, a testament to the power of community, and a reminder that sometimes, the most transformative changes start with something as simple as clean laundry and a friendly conversation.","Impact,Dignity,Expansion,Collaboration,Consistency,Accessibility","Anna King, the Health Programs Coordinator at Bega, provides insights into the impact of Orange Sky in Kalgoorlie and the broader Goldfields region.",148

In the heart of Mackay, a remarkable story of community engagement and personal growth unfolds through the eyes of Ashleigh Choice, a data analyst at Aurizon and dedicated Orange Sky volunteer. Ashleigh's journey with Orange Sky exemplifies the power of conversation, connection, and compassion in transforming not just the lives of those served, but also the volunteers themselves.
Ashleigh's involvement with Orange Sky began with the Sudsy Challenge, an initiative promoted within Aurizon, a key funder of Orange Sky. What started as a simple participation in a fundraising event soon blossomed into a profound commitment to the organization's mission. ""My favourite part about being and coming down to Orange Sky is the conversations,"" Ashleigh shares. ""I enjoy just the breadth and different types of people that you get to talk to, not just the volunteers but the people who attend the service as well.""
These conversations, often challenging and thought-provoking, have been a catalyst for personal growth. Ashleigh notes, ""I think it has changed how I then talk to people even at work, even with family and friends because it can be challenging. Conversations can be challenging and there's a lot of growth in that."" This growth extends beyond her personal life, influencing her professional interactions and family discussions.
Ashleigh's enthusiasm for Orange Sky is contagious. She successfully encouraged her entire team at Aurizon to participate in the Sudsy Challenge, creatively engaging them in the organization's mission. Her commitment has even led to a new role as the community engagement coordinator for Orange Sky in Mackay, where she manages newsletters and social media posts.
Family plays a significant role in Ashleigh's Orange Sky journey. Although her children are too young to volunteer, she regularly shares stories from her experiences. ""It's been really good. They see me in the morning every second Friday, don my orange sky shirt and it's been a really good conversation with them about what it looks like for families and that there are kids their age here sometimes,"" she explains. These conversations help her children understand the diverse experiences within their community and the importance of giving back.
Looking to the future, Ashleigh envisions growth for Orange Sky in Mackay. She sees potential for expanding services, particularly in the Northern Beaches area, to reach more people in need. Her plans include increasing her own volunteering capacity as her children grow older and potentially volunteering at Orange Sky locations in other cities during her work travels.
Ashleigh's story is a testament to the ripple effect of compassion and community engagement. Through her involvement with Orange Sky, she has not only made a difference in the lives of those the organization serves but has also experienced profound personal growth, inspired her colleagues and family, and contributed to the strengthening of her community.
As Orange Sky continues to grow and touch more lives, volunteers like Ashleigh remind us of the power of conversation and connection in building a more compassionate and understanding society. Her journey serves as an inspiration for others to get involved, showing that even small actions can lead to significant positive changes in our communities and ourselves.","Growth,Engagement,Inspiration,Perspective,Outreach,Commitment","Ashleigh Choice, a data analyst at Aurizon and Orange Sky volunteer, shares her experiences with the organisation in Mackay.

In the heart of Hamilton South Community Centre, a remarkable story of friendship and resilience unfolds. Meet Bob and Julie, two individuals whose lives have been touched by Orange Sky's mobile laundry service. Their story is a testament to the power of human connection and the impact of simple acts of kindness.

Bob, an 82-year-old gentleman, has been a regular at the Orange Sky van for five or six years. Julie, a more recent addition to the Orange Sky family, has been visiting for nearly two years. Despite their different backgrounds, they've formed a bond that transcends their circumstances.

""Bob's a normal person. I don't know. We just, yeah, we just talk to each other,"" Julie shares. ""I'd be there like a shot if Bob needed me.""

Their friendship, forged in the shadow of the Orange Sky van, is a beacon of hope in their challenging lives. Both Julie and Bob face housing insecurity and live in environments that are far from ideal. Julie, in particular, struggles with her current living situation, surrounded by individuals who pose a constant threat to her safety and well-being.

Yet, amidst these difficulties, Orange Sky provides more than just clean laundry – it offers a sense of community and belonging. The van has become a sanctuary where they can connect, converse, and find respite from their daily struggles.

""Oh, it felt great,"" Julie recalls her first experience with Orange Sky. ""Because I was paying a lady $5 a week to do me washing. And I said, oh, it's here. I'm going to do it.""

For Bob and Julie, the Orange Sky van is more than just a place to do laundry – it's a lifeline. It's where they find friendship, support, and a moment of normalcy in their otherwise challenging lives.

The volunteers at Orange Sky play a crucial role in creating this supportive environment. Bob speaks highly of Greg, one of the volunteers: ""Greg's unbelievable, though. What is it about Greg? He's the best guy in my life.""

These interactions, filled with kindness and free from judgment, provide Bob and Julie with a sense of dignity and respect that is often lacking in their daily lives.

Despite their hardships, both Bob and Julie maintain a remarkably positive outlook. They express gratitude for having a roof over their heads, acknowledging that there are others in far worse situations. ""I just think there's someone worse off, there's always someone worse off,"" Bob reflects. ""I'm not bad off, I'm happy the way I am.""

Their resilience in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. Julie, despite her current struggles, is actively seeking to improve her situation, hoping for a transfer to a better living environment. Bob, content with his current situation, finds joy in the simple things, like the conversations and connections he makes at the Orange Sky van.

The story of Bob and Julie is a powerful reminder of the impact Orange Sky has on the lives of those experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. It's not just about clean laundry – it's about restoring dignity, fostering connections, and building a community of support.

As we reflect on their story, we're reminded of the importance of human connection and the power of simple acts of kindness. Orange Sky's mission goes beyond providing a practical service; it creates a space where friendships like Bob and Julie's can flourish, offering hope and companionship to those who need it most.

In a world that can often feel isolating and harsh, especially for those facing homelessness, Orange Sky stands as a beacon of hope and humanity. Through its services and the dedication of its volunteers, it continues to make a profound difference in the lives of people like Bob and Julie, one load of laundry and one conversation at a time.","Friendship,Resilience,Community,Support,Dignity,Connection","Julie and Bob talk about underlying challenges and struggles they face.

In the heart of Hamilton South, a community center buzzes with activity every week as the Orange Sky van rolls in. Among the familiar faces is Bob Purdy, an 82-year-old retiree whose life has been brightened by this simple yet powerful service.

Bob's journey with Orange Sky began when a neighbor told him about the free mobile laundry service. Living in a one-bedroom unit with no space for a washing machine, Bob had been paying a neighbor $5 weekly to wash his clothes. ""This is great because it washes and they dry for you, which is fantastic,"" Bob shares, his eyes twinkling with appreciation.

But for Bob, Orange Sky offers more than just clean laundry. It's a lifeline of human connection in a community where he often feels isolated. ""Oh, it's really good. They're really great people that work for you. Unbelievable,"" he says of the volunteers.

At 82, Bob's world has naturally become smaller. ""I can't run around the block anymore like I used to,"" he chuckles. But twice a week, when the Orange Sky van arrives, his world expands. He sits, chats, and waits for his laundry, finding joy in the simple act of conversation.

One volunteer, in particular, has left a lasting impression on Bob. ""We got one bloke, Greg, is the most amazing man I've ever known in my life at 61 years old,"" Bob marvels. ""The things he's doing, I just can't... he's just unbelievable. He's so fit.""

These interactions are precious to Bob, especially given the challenges in his neighborhood. He mentions the prevalence of drug-related issues, which make it difficult for him to connect with many locals. Orange Sky provides a safe, positive environment where he can engage with others.

For Bob, and many like him, Orange Sky is more than a laundry service. It's a beacon of dignity, a source of connection, and a reminder that they matter. ""I think it's a fantastic job that they've done. Unbelievable,"" Bob reflects. ""One of the greatest things that someone could do.""

As we celebrate stories like Bob's, we're reminded of the profound impact that simple acts of kindness can have. Orange Sky isn't just washing clothes; it's weaving a fabric of community, one load at a time.

Bob's parting words sum it up perfectly: ""Quite happy with what they do and congratulate the mob that did it, that set it up."" Indeed, Bob. Indeed.","Community,Purpose,Inspiration","In this interview, Bob, an 82-year-old retiree, shares his experiences with Orange Sky and the positive impact the service has had on his life.",143

In the heart of Mackay, a remarkable collaboration between St. Patrick's College and Orange Sky is making waves in the community. Assistant Principal Brendan Gunning recently shared insights into this partnership, revealing how it's shaping students' perspectives and reinforcing the school's core values.
St. Patrick's College, a Catholic secondary school with about 1,500 students, prides itself on four key values: compassion, hope, justice, and respect. These values align perfectly with Orange Sky's mission, making the Brekkie Van program an ideal opportunity for students to put these principles into action.
""To partnership up with Orange Sky and run the Brekkie van is a great opportunity for our students to practice those values in the community,"" Gunning explains. This hands-on approach to community service has been met with overwhelming enthusiasm from the students. ""We never have any problems filling shifts. It's almost like the students are jumping over each other to get down here in the morning,"" Gunning says with a smile.
But it's not just about serving breakfast. The program offers students a chance to engage in meaningful conversations with people they might not otherwise meet. This interaction is challenging perceptions and broadening horizons. As Gunning notes, ""I think it really gives them a better understanding about a wide range of people in our community that they may not have already had.""
The impact of this program extends beyond the students. Staff members, including Gunning himself, regularly participate in the Brekkie Van shifts. ""I always sort of joke this is the highlight of my day,"" he shares. ""But I like to model the expectations. And if the kids see us down here rather than just asking them to come down, I think that's important.""
This commitment to leading by example is fostering a school-wide culture of community engagement and service. It's a win-win situation, benefiting not only the students and staff but also the broader Mackay community.
The partnership with Orange Sky has opened up new avenues for St. Patrick's College to fulfill its mission of community service. ""Sometimes we're a bit limited with opportunities for our students to provide service and to get out into the community,"" Gunning explains. ""And this has been a real win-win.""
As the program continues to grow from strength to strength, it's clear that this partnership is serving up much more than just breakfast. It's nourishing the community, challenging perceptions, and helping to shape the next generation of compassionate, engaged citizens.
The success of this collaboration between St. Patrick's College and Orange Sky serves as an inspiring example of how schools and community organizations can work together to create meaningful change. It's a testament to the power of service, conversation, and connection in building stronger, more empathetic communities.","Community,Education,Engagement","Brendan Gunning, Assistant Principal at St. Patrick's College in Mackay, discusses the school's partnership with Orange Sky's Brekkie Van program.",146

Tags: #Volunteering #Community #Connection #Impact

In the heart of a bustling community, Brett Klump has found his calling as a team leader with Orange Sky. His journey began just before the COVID pandemic hit, when he was searching for a new way to give back after years of volunteering in children's sports.

""I'm here volunteering, helping out our friends,"" Brett shares, his eyes lighting up as he talks about his role. ""It's all just giving back, helping people who just need help and it's just yeah, good group of people sharing time.""

Brett's commitment to the cause is evident in how he stepped into his leadership role. When others hesitated, he stepped forward. ""Everyone stepped back, so I stepped forward,"" he recalls. But for Brett, leadership isn't about control—it's about collaboration. ""We all run it, just all together... everyone shares an opinion, gives ideas and we go from there.""

One of the most rewarding aspects of Brett's work is the connections formed with the friends who use Orange Sky's services. ""We have other friends who come just for chats because we start here, you know, an hour before the meal starts,"" he explains. These moments of connection, of shared stories and experiences, are at the heart of what makes Orange Sky special.

While the work can be challenging at times, with Brett noting the need to always be alert to potential situations, the rewards far outweigh any difficulties. ""Whenever I come in here, I go home, I always feel good when I go home. I might be hungry or a bit tired, but you just feel good. It's just a good feeling to be out helping people who need help.""

For those considering volunteering, Brett's advice is simple: ""Just give it a crack. It's easy. You can always give it a crack and then decide, no, it's not for me."" He believes that everyone can find their place in volunteering, it's just a matter of trying different opportunities.

Brett's story is a testament to the power of volunteering—not just in the lives of those being helped, but in the lives of the volunteers themselves. Through Orange Sky, he's found a way to make a tangible difference in his community, one conversation, one load of laundry at a time.","Volunteering,Community,Impact,Connection",Brett emphasises the importance of giving back to the community and helping friends who need assistance.,104

In the heart of Mackay, a powerful partnership between Phoenix Place and Orange Sky is making a significant difference in the lives of those experiencing homelessness. Chris, a dedicated support worker at Phoenix Place, recently shared insights into this collaboration and its impact on the community.
For nearly two years, Chris has been a regular volunteer at Orange Sky's community service events. His motivation is simple yet profound: ""I just feel it's an opportunity where I can give back. There's a lot of people that need support and conversation, and I just take it as an opportunity to do that.""
The collaboration between Phoenix Place and Orange Sky is multifaceted. The kitchen staff at Phoenix prepare meals, which are then served by volunteers at Orange Sky events. But it's more than just providing food. As Chris explains, ""They do their washing here, they do their laundry. They're very appreciative of all the food they have. And just talk that conversation with them. It's somewhere for them to come and discuss what's happening in their lives.""
This holistic approach to support is crucial, especially in the face of rising living costs. Chris notes with concern, ""Groceries having doubled in the last 12 months. Their funding hasn't doubled. There's a lot of people who are in the system even and are really struggling. And that's very frustrating."" This economic pressure makes the services provided by Phoenix Place and Orange Sky even more vital.
What stands out about this collaboration is the emphasis on human connection. It's not just about meeting physical needs, but also providing a space for interaction and community. ""I think the people that come here, they feel, they interact. And it's somewhere for them to come. They get out of their normal day-to-day life,"" Chris observes. This opportunity for social interaction can be just as important as the practical services provided.
Chris's admiration for the work of Orange Sky is evident. He praises Lisa, who runs the organization, saying, ""She gives and gives and gives. It's amazing."" This spirit of generosity and dedication seems to be at the heart of both Phoenix Place and Orange Sky.
As for the future, Chris remains committed to his role in supporting the community. ""I love my job as a support worker. I love it. And I love coming here to Orange Sky,"" he says with enthusiasm. His dedication, along with that of countless other volunteers and staff members, ensures that those experiencing homelessness in Mackay will continue to have access to not just practical support, but also compassion and community.
The collaboration between Phoenix Place and Orange Sky serves as a powerful example of how local organizations can work together to address complex social issues. By providing a combination of practical support and human connection, they're not just meeting immediate needs, but also helping to build a more compassionate and inclusive community in Mackay.","Community,Impact,Connection","Chris, a support worker at Phoenix Place in Mackay, discusses his involvement with Orange Sky's community service program.",122

In the bustling city of Newcastle, Chris Dwyer has found a unique way to give back to his community through Orange Sky. As a full-time public servant with a young family, Chris discovered he had pockets of time that could be used for something greater than himself.

""I found gaps in that that I thought, oh, well, okay, I've got a bit of spare time. How can I use that, not on myself or my family? They come first. They're not going to be the first for the community at large,"" Chris shares, his eyes lighting up as he talks about his decision to volunteer.

Chris was drawn to Orange Sky after seeing it in the media, appreciating its independence from larger organizations. His journey with Orange Sky began with a positive onboarding experience, despite the challenges of COVID-19, and he quickly found a home with the team at Cross Church Cathedral Newcastle service.

But for Chris, Orange Sky is about more than just washing clothes. It's about the connections formed and the conversations shared. ""Really challenging for me is that discussion and conversations you have with friends. They're from all walks of life. All different life experiences, different ages,"" he explains.

Chris emphasizes the delicate balance required in these interactions: ""I think there's a bit of magic in knowing when to pull back and not asking too many incisive questions that can not upset but steer our friends."" This insight highlights the depth of impact volunteers can have beyond the practical service they provide.

The ripple effect of Chris's involvement with Orange Sky extends to his personal network. ""When people find out I work for Orange Sky, people's eyes light up,"" he says.

""It's just, it's about, it's everything,"" Dena explains. ""You know, it's not just about washing the clothes. It's about, you know, making people feel in themselves like, you know, you're fresh, your blankets are washed.""

For Dena and the community she serves, Orange Sky represents more than just a mobile laundry service. It's a lifeline of dignity, a platform for engagement, and a crucial link in a broader network of support services.

The impact is felt across various locations, from Church of Christ to Boulder Camp and Ningamia. Each site presents unique needs, but the core mission remains the same: restoring dignity through clean laundry and genuine human connection.

""It's about getting out there, engaging with the mob and just while they're washing their clothes, have a yarn,"" Dena shares, emphasizing the importance of these interactions. These conversations often lead to connections with other vital services, from NDIS support to mental health resources.

Looking to the future, Dena envisions expanding Orange Sky's reach.

This expansion could include not just more locations, but also tailored services for individual homes, especially for large families struggling with limited resources.

Kevin's life story is a powerful narrative of transformation and redemption. From experiencing homelessness and personal struggles to becoming a beacon of hope for others, Kevin's journey exemplifies the profound impact of community support and faith.
After reuniting with Veronica after 40 years, Kevin found a new purpose in life through street ministry and community service. His past experiences of living on the streets have given him a unique perspective on the challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness and social isolation.
At M25, a community hub in Kalgoorlie, Kevin sees the embodiment of unconditional love and support. ""It's a place for people to come and rest,"" he explains, emphasizing the importance of creating a judgment-free environment where people can find comfort and assistance.
Kevin's appreciation for the services provided at M25, including the Orange Sky laundry facilities, stems from his own experiences of struggling with dignity while homeless.

In the heart of Mount Isa, Keisha Neville, an Aboriginal health worker practitioner, is leading a crucial fight against rheumatic heart disease (RHD) through the Healthy Skin Project. Her work illustrates the vital importance of community-based healthcare and the power of collaboration in addressing complex health issues.
Keisha's role in the Healthy Skin Project focuses on a often-overlooked aspect of heart health: skin infections. ""Rheumatic heart disease is a disease that's been caused a lot of the time from skin infections,"" Keisha explains. ""Scabies and those infections lead to a strep-ache infection, which causes the valves to leak. And when they have leaky valves, that's when they have rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.""
Understanding the unique challenges faced by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Mount Isa, Keisha emphasizes the importance of addressing social determinants of health. ""Mount Isa has a large population of Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander people,"" she notes. ""The social determinants, I suppose, in health are some of the causes of some of the house disparities amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.""
Keisha's approach to healthcare is holistic and community-centered. She finds that working in the community is more effective than in a hospital setting. ""You're not just looking at that one person, you're looking at them holistically and also their whole family,"" she explains. This approach is crucial when dealing with highly contagious infections that can spread rapidly through families.
One of the key strategies in preventing RHD is maintaining good hygiene and cleanliness. Keisha and her team provide practical support, such as laundry powders and disinfectants, to help families maintain a healthy environment. However, recognizing the need for more comprehensive support, they've partnered with Orange Sky to provide free laundry services in the community.
""Linking in with Orange Sky, we got them to go around to clients' homes and some of the other places that they access in community,"" Keisha says. ""We let the clients know there was free access to washing of clothes and linen and stuff because that helps with the prevention of scabies and those sort of things to prevent them from getting acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.""
The collaboration with Orange Sky has been a success, not just in terms of providing practical support, but also in building trust within the community. Keisha notes that the Orange Sky team was friendly and culturally appropriate, making clients feel comfortable and reducing stigma.
Keisha's work underscores the importance of trust and relationship-building in community health. ""If you don't have trust you don't have the people,"" she states. Her approach emphasizes empowering clients with knowledge and education, enabling them to take control of their own healthcare.
As Keisha continues her mission in Mount Isa, her work serves as a powerful example of how community-based, culturally sensitive healthcare can make a real difference in preventing serious health conditions like RHD. Through education, prevention, and collaboration, Keisha and her team are not just treating diseases – they're building a healthier, more empowered community.","RHD,Prevention,Community,Hygiene","Keisha Neville, Aboriginal health worker, tackles rheumatic heart disease in Mount Isa through education, prevention, and collaboration.",136

In the heart of a community recovering from the impacts of COVID-19, Kylie's story stands as a testament to the power of support services and the resilience of the human spirit. Her journey, from discovering Orange Sky's services at a backpackers hostel in Sydney to becoming an advocate for community support, illustrates the transformative impact of organizations like Orange Sky.
Kylie's introduction to Orange Sky came during a challenging time in her life. ""I actually found out about Orange Sky years ago. I was actually out at a backpackers in the middle of Sydney,"" she recalls. ""That's how I found out about the laundry service. They have food vans down there usually around dinner time. So go down and get a free feed and do me washing as well.""
This experience left a lasting impression on Kylie, shaping her perspective on the importance of community support services. Now, she finds herself in a community grappling with the aftermath of the pandemic. ""Since COVID, a lot of people have moved. Yeah, so much has happened. A lot of businesses have also shut down,"" Kylie explains. ""So yeah, just everyone's in recovery mode, especially this year.""
Despite her own financial limitations, being on a pension, Kylie is determined to give back to her community. ""If I can, I volunteer,"" she says. ""I have offered these guys a couple of times, also a couple of times a week."" Her dedication to volunteering underscores the importance of community involvement in addressing social issues, particularly homelessness.
Kylie's appreciation for Orange Sky and similar services is evident in her description of how they operate. ""They have a little lunch on, so come up here, put your washing on, go get some lunch, and by the time lunch is finished, clothes are done,"" she explains. But she also sees room for growth, adding, ""I reckon they need to do so much more for the community. They're a really nice community center.""
One of Kylie's main concerns is the need for more comprehensive support for those experiencing homelessness. She points out a potential opportunity: ""There is a building here that's out of commission. I thought that they would have it for the homeless. I don't know if they did or not."" Her vision extends beyond just providing a place to stay, emphasizing the need for a ""step to recovery"" and linking people to long-term housing solutions.
Kylie also raises important questions about mental health support and community safety. She expresses concern about the allocation of funds for mental health services and the need for improved security measures in the community.
Through her story, Kylie highlights the multifaceted nature of homelessness and the importance of a holistic approach to addressing it. From laundry services and food vans to mental health support and temporary housing, each element plays a crucial role in supporting those in need and fostering community recovery.
Kylie's journey from service user to community advocate exemplifies the potential for positive change when individuals and organizations come together to support those in need. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that services like Orange Sky can have, not just in meeting immediate needs, but in empowering individuals to give back and contribute to their communities.","Resilience,Outreach,Hygiene,Accessibility","Kylie, once homeless, shares her journey with Orange Sky, highlighting the need for community support, mental health services, and comprehensive assistance.",156

In the heart of Hamilton South's social housing area, Leslie Lalor's story unfolds as a testament to the transformative power of volunteering. Her journey with Orange Sky not only changed her own life but also became an integral part of her community's fabric.
Leslie's path to Orange Sky began in a moment of personal transition. ""I had reached a stage where I had finished work,"" she recalls. ""My children were adults. My grandchildren had reached the stage. They didn't really want to spend holidays with Gran anymore."" It was during this time that Leslie stumbled upon an article about Orange Sky in the Newcastle Herald, sparking a new chapter in her life.
Her volunteering journey started with driving the Orange Sky van to Port Stephens, but it was the COVID-19 pandemic that deepened her involvement. ""After COVID, I got more involved,"" Leslie explains. ""I was down at the Swansea shift. Bit by bit, things happened. People resigned. And yeah, now I'm a team leader here.""
Leslie's shift in Hamilton South serves a unique community. ""We're in a social housing area here at the community hall,"" she describes. ""It's what I would call a fractured society. It's a little bit... there's lots of issues in here, but there's lots of beautiful people as well."" This environment provides a backdrop for the powerful connections formed through Orange Sky's services.
One of the most profound aspects of Leslie's experience has been the relationships formed with the ""friends"" who use Orange Sky's services. She speaks fondly of Julie and Bob, regular visitors to the shift. ""Julie, in particular, loves us being here. It gets her out of her little one-room, confined apartment,"" Leslie shares, highlighting how Orange Sky provides more than just clean laundry – it offers a lifeline of social connection.
Leslie's journey with Orange Sky has also been one of personal growth and changing perceptions. ""I used to not communicate very well with homeless people. I would feel embarrassed about them and I would sort of kind of walk past,"" she admits. However, through her experiences, Leslie's perspective has dramatically shifted. ""Now I'm up front, I go straight up to them. If I see anybody sitting outside the shops or on the street somewhere, I will either ask them what they would like to eat if I'm going into a shop and buy them something to eat... or I will stop and even sit down beside them and have a yak.""
This transformation in Leslie's approach underscores a crucial insight she gained through her volunteering: the importance of human connection. ""The thing he struggled with most is the sense of social isolation, that people wouldn't talk to him,"" Leslie recalls from a conversation with one of the friends. This realization has fueled her commitment to making every interaction count.
Leslie's story also highlights the reciprocal nature of volunteering. While she provides an invaluable service to her community, she also gains a sense of purpose and continues to learn and grow. ""I've had to use my head a lot with the journey with Orange Sky as well,"" she says, describing her experience with new systems and roles within the organization.
For those considering volunteering, Leslie's advice is simple yet powerful: ""Do it. Just do it. Just come join us."" Her journey from retiree to community champion through Orange Sky serves as an inspiring example of how one person's willingness to serve can create ripples of positive change throughout a community.
Leslie's story reminds us that at the heart of services like Orange Sky lies the power of human connection. Through clean laundry, warm conversations, and genuine care, volunteers like Leslie are not just providing a service – they're weaving the fabric of a more compassionate and connected community.","Hygiene,Impact,Support,Connection","Leslie, a retired volunteer, shares her transformative journey with Orange Sky, highlighting the impact of community connections and personal growth.",149

In the heart of Mackay, a coastal city in Queensland, Lisa J stands proud as the service leader for Orange Sky's innovative laundry pods. Her story is one of community, connection, and the transformative power of a simple conversation.
Lisa oversees two pods in the Mackay area, including the world's first Orange Sky pod in Serena. ""We've got the first ever pod that Orange Sky put in the world, we like to say. And that's Donny down in Serena,"" Lisa explains with evident pride. These permanent fixtures have become beacons of hope and accessibility for those in need.
The pods, unlike the mobile vans, offer a consistent presence in the community. ""It certainly makes us loud and proud and visible,"" Lisa notes. ""And that's probably one of the key things that works for us is that people know we're here and where to find us."" This visibility has fostered a strong connection between Orange Sky and the Mackay community, which Lisa describes as ""such a giving and caring community.""
But it's not just about clean laundry. Lisa emphasizes the crucial role of the iconic Orange Sky chairs. ""The chairs are the big thing about our shifts,"" she explains. ""Laundry is good for the hygiene. Our service providers bring the food, which is good for people's sustenance... But it's that time in between when people get the chance to talk. And that you understand more about that person. And, you know, it just humanises people.""
These conversations can be life-changing. Lisa shares a poignant story: ""I've had examples where I've met someone here on Wednesday morning and been speaking to them. I've gone to another volunteering role on Thursday afternoon and saw them down there and had a chat here. Hi, how are you going? And I was really taken aback to say, well, you're the only person that I've spoken to in that whole time."" This stark reminder of the isolation many face underscores the vital role Orange Sky plays in fostering human connection.
The Orange Sky pods also serve as a hub for connecting people with other support services. Lisa mentions their partnership with Vinnies, highlighting how these conversations can lead to further assistance and support.
For those considering volunteering, Lisa's enthusiasm is contagious. ""Hey, come down and give it a try,"" she encourages. The diversity of volunteers, from university students to 80-year-olds, reflects the inclusive nature of Orange Sky's mission. Lisa emphasizes that volunteering is a two-way street: ""As much as you think it's a giving role, they'll all walk away with a big smile on their face and think, Hey, that was a good shift. I didn't realise I'd get so much out of it that I do.""
Lisa's story with Orange Sky in Mackay is a testament to the power of community engagement and the profound impact of human connection. Through the simple act of providing laundry services and a friendly ear, Orange Sky is weaving a stronger, more compassionate community fabric, one load of laundry and one conversation at a time.
In a world that can often feel disconnected, Lisa and the Orange Sky team in Mackay remind us of the transformative power of simple acts of kindness and the enduring strength of community bonds.","Prevention,Outreach,Community,partnership","Lisa, Orange Sky's service leader in Mackay, highlights the impact of permanent laundry pods, emphasising the transformative power of volunteering.",147

In the bustling town of Mackay, 19-year-old Luke Watkins has found a unique way to give back to his community through volunteering with Orange Sky. His story is one of youthful enthusiasm, genuine connection, and personal growth that serves as an inspiration for aspiring volunteers of all ages.
Luke's journey with Orange Sky began through his mother's involvement with the local church. ""I first found out about Orange Sky, it was actually through my mum,"" Luke explains. ""She does some work over at the church and she deals with some affected people in the area, and they all pretty much had good things to say about what you guys do here.""
Despite his young age, Luke's commitment to volunteering is impressive. As soon as he turned 18, the minimum age for Orange Sky volunteers, he eagerly signed up. ""When I was 18, came over, gave it a shot, and loved it,"" he recalls with enthusiasm.
For Luke, volunteering with Orange Sky isn't just about providing practical services like laundry or food. It's about human connection. ""They just want to be treated like a friend, like a normal person,"" Luke observes about the people he meets during his shifts. ""They're great people to talk to. Everyone has their own story.""
This emphasis on genuine interaction and friendship is at the heart of Luke's volunteering experience. ""It makes me feel awesome to, you know, make them feel heard, and genuinely, you know, enjoy and listen to their stories,"" he shares. Luke's approach embodies Orange Sky's mission of fostering connection and dignity through conversation.
Luke's perspective on homelessness has been shaped by his experiences both in Mackay and during visits to family in the United States. He recalls seeing homelessness more prominently in Phoenix, Arizona, where his family would make a point of bringing food and engaging in conversation with those in need. This early exposure clearly influenced his current dedication to volunteering.
When asked about the impact of Orange Sky, Luke is quick to highlight both the practical and emotional benefits. ""Look, it does help. Like the immediately obvious stuff is people get clean clothes, people get some food, people get some water and people get access to any help they need,"" he explains. But for Luke, the most significant impact goes beyond these tangible services. ""The biggest thing for me though is just them being heard, them being talked to, them being treated like just anyone else.""
Luke's commitment to volunteering is all the more impressive given his busy schedule as a full-time engineering student who also works multiple jobs. Yet, he finds the time and energy to give back to his community through Orange Sky, demonstrating that age and a busy lifestyle are not barriers to making a difference.
The personal growth Luke has experienced through volunteering is evident in his reflections. ""Every time I come out of it it's just definitely growth, absolutely. Just understanding how other people live because I've always been very fortunate,"" he shares. This increased empathy and understanding of diverse life experiences is a powerful testament to the transformative potential of volunteering.
For those considering volunteering with Orange Sky, Luke's advice is simple and encouraging: ""Come down, have a chat to us and if you want to let us know that you're thinking about volunteering we'll run you through everything, what's involved."" His enthusiasm is contagious, and his story serves as a powerful example of how young people can make a significant impact in their communities.
Luke's journey with Orange Sky in Mackay is more than just a story of volunteering. It's a reminder of the power of human connection, the importance of treating everyone with dignity, and the profound personal growth that can come from serving others. As Luke continues his studies and his volunteer work, he stands as an inspiring example of how one young person can make a meaningful difference in their community.","Growth,Prevention,Purpose,Commitment","Luke Watkins, a 19-year-old student, shares his transformative experience volunteering with Orange Sky in Mackay.",113

In the heart of Mackay, Matthew Neill has found a new purpose that goes beyond his successful career as a financial advisor. Through his volunteer work with Orange Sky, Matthew has discovered the profound impact of human connection and the transformative power of community service.
Matthew's journey with Orange Sky began unexpectedly at a business conference in Shanghai. ""I was lucky enough to attend a conference with my licensee,"" he recalls. It was there that he heard the Orange Sky founders speak, and their message resonated deeply with him. ""One of the most moving, touching things I think I've had at one of these events was hearing the boys articulate their story and this story about connection and connecting with people,"" Matthew shares.
This emphasis on connection struck a chord with Matthew. He realized that Orange Sky's mission went beyond providing practical services like laundry to those experiencing homelessness. ""What I took from it was this ability to connect and the impact you have connecting with people,"" he explains. This realization was the catalyst for Matthew's involvement with Orange Sky as a volunteer.
Matthew's perspective on homelessness has evolved significantly through his work with Orange Sky. ""I think you don't really know,"" he reflects on his prior understanding. ""There's a lot of stigma that gets attached to people that are homeless. And I think unless you actually spend the time and get to know them and understand them and hear the stories, you don't really actually understand.""
This newfound understanding has been one of the most valuable aspects of Matthew's volunteer experience. He emphasizes the importance of moving beyond preconceptions and truly engaging with individuals: ""Certainly coming to Orange Sky gives me that sense of understanding and knowing, not just this outside perception or listening to the dogma or the stigma that you hear in the community.""
For Matthew, the impact of Orange Sky extends beyond the individuals they serve directly. He sees it as a vital part of building a stronger, more connected community. As someone who moved to Mackay from Melbourne ten years ago, Matthew appreciates the tight-knit nature of his new community. ""Community, mate. 100%,"" he responds when asked what keeps him in Mackay. ""I think you really know your neighbour. And I think that's something that you can miss in the big city.""
Matthew's commitment to community is evident in his approach to volunteering. He distinguishes between financial donations and the donation of time and presence. ""It's easy to give your money and donate and donate your money and your funds. It's a lot different when you start to donate your time,"" he explains. ""You can actually see the change you're actually having a part of, as opposed to, you know, handing over some money and a cheque and not quite knowing what that's going to do.""
This hands-on involvement has given Matthew a deeper sense of purpose. ""Can I make a bigger impact and have a greater sense of being and sense of purpose? And I think for me, that's the biggest thing I get out of Orange Sky,"" he shares. This sentiment echoes the experiences of many volunteers who find fulfillment in direct community service.
Matthew also recognizes the broader impact of Orange Sky's work, particularly in collaboration with other local services. ""Just those two services working together is what draws people in, makes them aware of what Orange Sky can do for them,"" he observes. This collaborative approach not only provides essential services but also creates a welcoming space for social interaction and community building.
For those considering volunteering, Matthew's advice is enthusiastic and encouraging. ""If you enjoy spending time with people and you enjoy talking to people and getting to know them and understand and listen... then put them to use and give it a go,"" he urges. His own experience of finding a welcoming community among both fellow volunteers and the friends they serve is a testament to the rewarding nature of this work.
Matthew Neill's journey with Orange Sky is more than just a story of volunteering. It's a powerful example of how engaging with our communities can lead to personal growth, deeper understanding, and a renewed sense of purpose. Through his work with Orange Sky, Matthew has not only contributed to his community but has also discovered a new dimension of fulfillment in his own life.","Connection,Consistency,Resilience,Commitment","Matthew Neill, a financial advisor, shares his transformative journey with Orange Sky, highlighting the power of human connection and finding purpose.",150

In the heart of a community center that collaborates with Orange Sky, Melissa Legg has found a new purpose that transformed her life. Her story is a powerful testament to the healing power of community service and the importance of non-judgmental support.
Melissa's journey to volunteering began in the wake of a personal crisis. ""Actually, four months post-suicide attempt,"" she shares candidly. ""So I came here about two months ago when I was ready to look at what I was going to do."" What started as a search for a judgment-free environment quickly evolved into a full-time commitment that has given Melissa a new lease on life.
""I was looking for something to do where there's no judgment. I've got a pretty sketchy past,"" Melissa explains. This need for acceptance led her to the community center, where she found not just a volunteer opportunity, but a new family. ""I love it here. I love being with these guys. I love catching up with them, yarning, seeing how they're going. Helping them out where I can.""
Melissa's experience highlights the transformative power of community engagement. She describes how building trust with the community she serves has been a gradual but rewarding process. ""Very untrusting because they've got a lot of cultural stuff. But once you spend time with them and you show that you're interested and you show that you actually care, they are very opening, welcoming.""
The impact of Orange Sky's services, particularly their laundry facilities, is a key focus of Melissa's work. ""We'd be lost without it,"" she emphasizes. ""Because, as you say, in the section I work in like we do store a little bit, but some of these guys, they're homeless. They have a blanket and a pillow and sleep in the dirt or in a sleeping bag."" The ability to provide clean clothes is more than just a practical service; it's a way of restoring dignity to those who have little else.
Melissa's perspective on the importance of non-judgmental support is shaped by her own experiences. ""I've been judged my whole life so the last thing I want to do is judge anyone else,"" she shares. This attitude forms the cornerstone of her approach to volunteering and has helped her build strong connections within the community.
The collaborative nature of the services provided at the center is another aspect Melissa highlights. From Orange Sky's laundry services to healthcare providers and even visiting hairdressers, the center acts as a hub for various support services. ""It's just all those little things that make a difference to the people that don't have access to this,"" Melissa explains.
Despite the positive impact of their work, Melissa expresses frustration with the lack of government recognition for their services. ""I know that because this is run by a church, it's not classified as an essential service by the government. So we don't get government funding,"" she laments. This challenge underscores the importance of community support and the dedication of volunteers like Melissa.
For Melissa, the concept of friendship that Orange Sky promotes resonates deeply. ""Support. Understanding,"" she says when asked what friendship means to her in this context. ""Everybody makes mistakes and you need to be willing to put those in the past and give people a chance and try and help them to do better.""
Melissa's story is a powerful reminder of the impact one person can have when they choose to serve others. Her journey from personal crisis to community champion illustrates the healing power of volunteering and the importance of creating non-judgmental spaces where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
As Melissa puts it, ""Everyone's treated the same here. When you walk in that gate, you treat us with respect and dignity and we'll treat you the same."" This simple yet profound philosophy underscores the transformative power of community service, not just for those being served, but for the volunteers themselves.","Hygiene,Commitment,Collaboration,Expansion","Melissa Legg, a volunteer at a community centre, shares her journey of finding purpose, highlighting the impact of non-judgmental support.",138

In the heart of Mackay, Michael ""Bear"" Young's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the transformative impact of genuine care and human connection. Through his experiences with Orange Sky, Bear has found not just practical support, but a pathway to reclaiming his dignity and sense of self-worth.
Bear's journey to Orange Sky was marked by significant challenges. A serious accident in 2005 led to nerve damage and addiction to prescription drugs. The loss of his father to dementia further compounded his struggles, pushing him into a deep depression. ""When my father died, I just lost the plot. I didn't care anymore,"" Bear recalls.
It was in this state of crisis that Bear found his way to Orange Sky. What began as a simple need to do laundry evolved into something far more profound. ""Apart from being able to do my washing, it was the companionship,"" Bear explains. The volunteers at Orange Sky provided more than just clean clothes; they offered a listening ear and a non-judgmental presence that proved crucial to Bear's recovery.
One of the most striking aspects of Bear's story is his emphasis on the genuine care he experiences at Orange Sky. ""Orange Sky are volunteers. They care because they care, not because they're paid to care. And that is a huge difference,"" he states. This authenticity of connection has been instrumental in helping Bear confront his past and look towards the future.
Bear's experiences highlight the profound impact of loneliness and social isolation on mental health and well-being. ""When you're lonely, you feel forgotten. And when you feel forgotten, you stop caring about yourself, your situation,"" he observes. Orange Sky has provided a crucial counterpoint to these feelings, offering a space where Bear feels valued and understood.
The dignity afforded by Orange Sky's services is another key theme in Bear's story. ""It gives us, it sounds cliché, but it actually gives us dignity here. Whereas everywhere else, if you're poor, homeless, living in housing, you're treated like a second class citizen by most people,"" he shares. This restoration of dignity has been a cornerstone of Bear's recovery process.
Looking to the future, Bear is focused on improving his health and finding more stable accommodation. He credits Orange Sky with providing the support that allows him to work towards these goals. ""This is the one place that I feel safe. I feel wanted. And it's somewhere where if I want to socialise, I can. If I don't want to socialise, I don't have to. And people will be there for me,"" he explains.
Bear's story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that genuine care and connection can have on an individual's life. It underscores the importance of non-judgmental support and the role that organizations like Orange Sky play in combating loneliness and social isolation. Through the simple act of providing laundry services and conversation, Orange Sky has helped Bear and countless others find a path back to dignity, self-worth, and hope for the future.
As Bear's journey continues, his story stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of community support. It reminds us that sometimes, the most profound changes begin with the simplest acts of kindness and connection.","Consistency,Commitment,Homelessness,Friendship","Michael ""Bear"" Young shares his journey from personal crisis to finding hope and dignity through Orange Sky's services.",119

At the bustling Trambi hub in Perth, Rita and Min exemplify the spirit of Orange Sky's mission. Their stories of volunteering highlight the profound impact of human connection and the transformative power of community service.
Rita, a team leader and service coordinator, has been with Orange Sky for about seven years. Her dedication to serving those experiencing homelessness shines through in every interaction. ""I think it's fantastic to give something back to people who are less fortunate than we are,"" Rita explains. Her motivation stems from a deep empathy for those facing hardship, especially during harsh winter months.
For Rita, the relationships formed with the ""friends"" who use Orange Sky's services are at the heart of her volunteering experience. ""These people really mean something to us,"" she shares. The term ""friends"" takes on a special significance in this context, representing a connection that goes beyond the typical service provider-client relationship.
Rita's experiences at Trambi have been a mix of joy and heartbreak. She recounts success stories of friends finding employment and housing, but also touches on the tragic reality of lives lost to suicide among the homeless community. These experiences underscore the critical importance of the support and connections provided by Orange Sky.
Min, a newer volunteer, brings a fresh perspective to the team. Coming from the corporate world, Min was drawn to Orange Sky by a desire to make a more direct impact on people's lives. ""I looked up various organisations, looked at Orange Sky's website. I thought it was very informative, really like the mission, the founders. That just seemed really progressive,"" Min explains.
For Min, volunteering with Orange Sky has been an eye-opening and humbling experience. ""It's very humbling, you know, and putting my own, I guess, ego aside and just realizing this can happen to anyone as well,"" she reflects. This realization speaks to the power of Orange Sky in breaking down barriers and fostering understanding between different segments of society.
Both Rita and Min emphasize the importance of open-mindedness and non-judgmental attitudes in volunteering with Orange Sky. They see their role as not just providing practical services like laundry, but also offering dignity, respect, and genuine human connection to those who often feel invisible in society.
The impact of Orange Sky extends beyond the friends it serves. For volunteers like Rita and Min, it provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment that transcends their professional lives. Min's experience highlights how volunteering can offer a meaningful counterbalance to corporate work, providing a direct way to help people and contribute to the community.
Rita and Min's stories at Trambi showcase the multifaceted nature of Orange Sky's impact. From providing essential services to fostering deep human connections, from offering volunteers a chance for personal growth to creating a more compassionate community, Orange Sky's work touches lives in profound and lasting ways.
As Rita and Min continue their journey with Orange Sky, their experiences serve as a powerful reminder of the difference that genuine care and connection can make in people's lives.

In the bustling streets of Fremantle, Muhammad Patel's story unfolds as a testament to the transformative power of community service. For over a decade, Muhammad has been a dedicated volunteer, serving the homeless community and challenging societal misconceptions along the way.
Muhammad's journey began unexpectedly in 2014 when a Facebook post caught his eye. ""I wasn't meant to, like, be involved, like, long-term at all,"" he recalls. ""I was fully expecting that I'd just do it, like, once a month, once every two months."" Little did he know that this casual interest would evolve into a life-changing commitment.
Born in Zambia and now living in Perth, Muhammad brings a unique perspective to his volunteer work. His Muslim faith played a role in his decision to get involved, as he saw it as an opportunity to express his values in a meaningful way. ""I'm Muslim, right? So there's not a lot of Muslim outlets to express ourselves in this fashion,"" he explains.
What started as a curiosity quickly became an eye-opening experience for Muhammad. The realities of homelessness he encountered challenged his preconceptions and ignited a passion for service. ""I couldn't just help myself,"" he says, describing his transition from occasional volunteer to weekly participant.
Over the years, Muhammad's understanding of homelessness has deepened significantly. He reflects on his initial misconceptions with candor: ""With the arrogance of youth, that's maybe... that I held as well you know we live in the lucky country and you've got every single piece of infrastructure and services available to you why can't you get yourself up but once you actually start interacting you're like wow this is I was such an idiot and this this issue is so much more nuanced than I could ever imagine.""
One of the most powerful aspects of Muhammad's experience has been the friendships formed, both with those experiencing homelessness and fellow volunteers. ""I think we've been doing it for so long now that, like, we've both become friends with the homeless people. Um, and then ourselves, we've actually become good friends as well,"" he shares. This dual sense of connection underscores the reciprocal nature of community service.
Muhammad's perspective on friendship extends beyond personal relationships to the broader concept of community support. ""Collaboration is just, I guess, another word for support. And that's what, like, when you have friendships, you have your community, these are the pillars of that,"" he explains. This understanding of collaboration as a foundation for community resilience informs his approach to service.
Despite the rewarding nature of his work, Muhammad acknowledges the challenges, particularly in terms of public perception. He outlines three common responses to his volunteer work: admiration, skepticism about the need for such services, and concern that providing support enables dependence. These varied reactions highlight the ongoing need for education and awareness about the complexities of homelessness.
Looking to the future, Muhammad harbors hopes of expanding their services, perhaps even establishing a kitchen and housing facilities. However, he remains pragmatic about the challenges of balancing volunteer work with personal and professional commitments.
Muhammad Patel's journey from a curious onlooker to a dedicated long-term volunteer illustrates the profound impact that community engagement can have on both individuals and society at large. His story serves as an inspiration for others to challenge their preconceptions, engage with their communities, and discover the transformative power of service and friendship.","Prevention,Outreach,Connection,partnership","Muhammad Patel, a long-term volunteer, shares his journey of serving the homeless community in Perth, highlighting the power of friendship.",139

Nicole Dobson's story is a poignant reminder of how quickly life circumstances can change and the vital role community support plays in times of need. Her experience with sudden housing insecurity and her observations about Orange Sky's services offer valuable insights into the challenges many face and the power of compassionate community initiatives.
Nicole, who moved to the Central Coast area from northern New South Wales five years ago, recently found herself in an unexpected situation. ""I've just recently though had to move,"" she explains. ""I was living in a lovely sort of duplex kind of house in Swansea Heads with great views and it was just like an absolute wonderful find of a house and that sold suddenly with the buyer stipulating vacancy."" This abrupt change left Nicole with just 30 days to find new accommodation, a challenge that opened her eyes to the housing crisis affecting many in her community.
Through her search for new housing, Nicole discovered the extent of the problem. ""It wasn't until I was in this situation and actually looking on, you know, private rental sites and different groups on Facebook that I realised how many people were desperate for houses and, you know, have been months, some even years, without getting accepted."" This experience gave her a newfound appreciation for the struggles many families face, including those living in their cars due to lack of affordable housing options.
Nicole's story highlights a particular challenge faced by immigrants seeking housing. She shares an example: ""There was a family that they'd migrated here. So the wife had specialised nursing skills. So they were brought in. She's working full time. But he can't find work yet... And they've got kids and they're all living in their car. They can't get a house because they haven't got references. They haven't got an Australian rental history."" This situation underscores the need for more comprehensive support systems for those new to the country, especially those brought in to fill specialized roles.
It was during this challenging time that Nicole discovered Orange Sky's services. ""I think I'd just come down to the library and I'd seen you guys and I'd just asked what was happening,"" she recalls. The free laundry service provided by Orange Sky has been a valuable resource for Nicole, especially given the high costs of using local laundromats.
But for Nicole, the impact of Orange Sky goes far beyond the practical service of clean laundry. She emphasizes the non-judgmental approach and kindness of the volunteers: ""I love that there's no questions asked. They don't, there's no discrimination. So if you don't look homeless, you're not, you know, shunned or anything. In fact, you know, they're just beautiful people that welcome you and sit down and have a chat with you.""
Nicole believes that the impact of this kindness is immeasurable. ""I don't know that you can measure that. I think you can't measure kindness,"" she says. ""I mean, it can have a profound effect on a person's day. To have a small bit of kindness in the morning can mean that someone can have a wonderful day because it, you know, when we smile at one another with genuine warmth and care, it's a wonderful thing.""
The volunteer-led model of Orange Sky is something Nicole particularly appreciates. She believes it keeps the organization grounded and focused on people rather than metrics: ""I think it just keeps it very down to earth. Then it's very people-oriented. If it's a job, it tends to change everything, doesn't it? It becomes about money and about outcomes and about, you know, reaching yourself. Reaching your CPIs and all of that jazz. It's just when it's volunteers, we're all in it together kind of thing.""
Nicole Dobson's story serves as a powerful reminder of the precariousness of housing security and the vital role that organizations like Orange Sky play in supporting those facing hardship. Her experience highlights not only the practical value of services like free laundry but also the profound impact of kindness and non-judgmental support. As communities continue to grapple with housing affordability and homelessness, stories like Nicole's underscore the importance of compassionate, volunteer-led initiatives in fostering a sense of dignity and belonging for all members of society.","Community,Engagement,Inspiration,Homelessness",Nicole Dobson shares her experience with housing insecurity and highlights the crucial role of Orange Sky in providing practical support and kindness.,150

In the coastal community of Belmont, Pam Wellham's story unfolds as a testament to the power of community service and the innovative approaches to addressing homelessness. As a member of the Rotary Club of Belmont and a dedicated Orange Sky volunteer, Pam's journey illustrates the profound impact that retirees can have when they choose to give back to their communities.
Pam's introduction to Orange Sky came through her involvement with Rotary. ""I found out about Orange Sky just so I think on the radio or something. And then I asked one of the gentlemen who was in charge of Orange Sky in the Hunter area to come along to a Rotary meeting and talk to the Rotarians about Orange Sky,"" she recalls. This intersection of two service-oriented organizations sparked Pam's interest and led to her becoming a committed Orange Sky volunteer.
For Pam, the decision to volunteer with Orange Sky was driven by a deep-seated belief in the importance of giving back. ""I think giving back to the community is something that really makes you feel better,"" she explains. ""Volunteers always seem to be a happier type of people, and they like to just see other people benefiting from the time that they have free."" This philosophy, deeply rooted in her Rotary background where the motto is ""service above self,"" has guided Pam's approach to retirement.
Pam's experience with Orange Sky has opened her eyes to the diverse needs of those experiencing homelessness or hardship. She notes that Orange Sky's services aren't just for those living on the streets: ""Sometimes they're living in their car, which is homeless, but, you know, they live in their car, they can get a shower, but they can't find... get their washing done. Or they're in public housing, or they've been given an opportunity to go to a motel, and motels don't have... necessarily have washing facilities.""
The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges and highlighted the importance of Orange Sky's services. Pam observed that during this time, ""people were... they weren't out and about. And I think emotionally or mental health issues arose because they didn't meet with people. So we were doing shifts during COVID... it allowed people to come and talk to us and have someone to assist them.""
One of the most striking aspects of Pam's experience is the connections formed with regular users of the service. She speaks fondly of the relationships built over time: ""The friends who come on a regular basis, they change over the time that you know them. So one of the gentlemen hasn't been here today. He hasn't been here for a few weeks. So we're all a bit worried. Where is he? What's happened to him?"" These connections underscore the human element of Orange Sky's work, going beyond just providing clean laundry to offering a sense of community and care.
Pam is particularly impressed by the innovative nature of Orange Sky's mobile laundry service. ""I think you do need innovation because this van can be taken anywhere,"" she notes. ""I mean, if you haven't got a water supply, we can have clean water. We can have water there."" This adaptability and innovation are what Pam believes are crucial in addressing the complex needs of those experiencing homelessness.
Looking to the future, Pam sees a need for more innovative approaches to social issues. ""We've been doing the same thing for many years. We should, you know, use some of the resources that are available to see what, how we can better help the people who aren't as fortunate as we are,"" she reflects. Her experience with Orange Sky has reinforced her belief in the power of fresh ideas and adaptable solutions to community challenges.
Pam Wellham's story is a powerful reminder of the impact that individuals can have when they choose to engage with their communities. Her journey from Rotary member to Orange Sky volunteer illustrates the interconnectedness of community service organizations and the ongoing need for innovative approaches to addressing social issues. Through her dedication and compassion, Pam exemplifies the positive change that can occur when we choose to give our time and energy to those in need.","Community,Education,Transformation,Impact","Pam Wellham, a Rotary member and Orange Sky volunteer, shares her insights on community service, innovation.",108

In the heart of Mackay, Paul Gordon's story unfolds as a compelling example of how corporate partnerships can drive meaningful change in communities. As a representative of Aurizon, Australia's largest rail freight organization, Paul provides unique insights into the company's decade-long partnership with Orange Sky, illustrating how shared values and innovative thinking can create impactful community initiatives.
Paul's journey with Aurizon spans ten years and multiple locations across Australia. His current role overseeing a maintenance contract in Mackay has given him a front-row seat to the company's engagement with Orange Sky. ""Aurizon is very much focused on giving back to the community in which we operate,"" Paul explains. This commitment to community support aligns perfectly with Orange Sky's mission, creating a natural partnership.
The collaboration between Aurizon and Orange Sky goes beyond financial support. Paul emphasizes the importance of employee volunteering: ""Beyond the financial support that we provide, a lot of Aurizon staff, myself included, provide that volunteering support as well."" This dual approach of financial and time investment underscores Aurizon's commitment to making a tangible difference in their communities.
One of the most innovative aspects of Aurizon's partnership with Orange Sky is the barbecue trailer project in Serena, a community about 30km south of Mackay. Paul describes how Aurizon's apprentices were tasked with building a purpose-built trailer as part of their project work. ""We asked our apprentices down at the maintenance facility to build a purpose-built trailer as one of their projects, which they did. And in classic engineering and Aurizon form, we went all out,"" Paul shares with pride.
This barbecue trailer now serves as a focal point for community engagement, with various Aurizon teams taking turns on an eight-week rotating roster to provide food services alongside Orange Sky's laundry pod. ""We head down there and cook sausages, onions and provide it to the friends of Orange Sky in the hope that food brings them in to then connect them to the services that they may need from time to time,"" Paul explains.
Paul's experience with Orange Sky has profoundly shifted his perspective on homelessness. He reflects, ""What's changed my perspective around the definition of homelessness or what that classical view of someone living on the streets is that's shifted quite a lot."" He acknowledges the reality of the cost of living crisis and how quickly circumstances can change for individuals, especially in areas with low vacancy rates like Mackay.
Looking to the future, Paul sees potential for further expansion of services. He mentions an ongoing project to convert an unused toilet block into shower facilities, which would complement the existing laundry and food services. ""When you think of you've got shower, toilet, laundry services and food, that's kind of like the golden triangle of providing that dignity of service,"" he notes.
Paul's story highlights the power of corporate partnerships in addressing social issues. By aligning Aurizon's values with Orange Sky's mission, they've created a model of community engagement that goes beyond traditional corporate social responsibility. Through innovative projects like the barbecue trailer and consistent volunteer involvement, Aurizon and Orange Sky are working together to provide essential services and foster social connections in communities across Australia.
As Paul and his team at Aurizon continue to support and innovate alongside Orange Sky, their partnership serves as an inspiring example of how businesses can play a crucial role in addressing community needs and promoting social inclusion.","Community,Collaboration,partnership,Education","Paul Gordon, an Aurizon representative, shares insights on the company's partnership with Orange Sky, highlighting community engagement.",136

In the heart of Kalgoorlie, where the red earth meets the vast sky, there's a man known simply as Phillip. He's not one for many words, but his actions speak volumes. Every day, before the sun fully rises, Phillip is there with his Orange Sky van, ready to ""smash it out"" as he puts it.
""I just start here about sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning, just come and just smash it out,"" Phillip says, his humble words belying the profound impact of his work. ""It's not complicated, you know? Just wash, dry, wash, dry. But for some folks, those clean clothes mean everything.""
To the community, Phillip is more than just the laundry guy. He's a constant, a reliable presence in lives often marked by uncertainty. His Nudju heritage and background working in mines and with Life Without Barriers have given him a unique perspective on the struggles and strengths of the people he serves.
""I'm from Norseman, Nudju country,"" he explains. ""Used to work in the mines, then Life Without Barriers. Now I'm here. Different work, same idea - helping people stand tall. Clean clothes help with that, you know?""
The community speaks of Phillip with a warmth reserved for family. They appreciate his quiet efficiency, his non-judgmental presence, and his unwavering commitment. As one community member put it, ""Phillip, he's just there, you know? No fuss, no big talk. But he's there, and that means something.""
Phillip's impact goes beyond clean clothes. He's become a thread in the fabric of the community, connecting people through this simple yet essential service. ""I suppose seeing all the family of it, I suppose. The majority of them,"" he reflects. ""They come past, have a yarn, and cruise around somewhere else, another one comes. It's like a circle, you know? Always moving, but always coming back.""
The Orange Sky service, under Phillip's care, has become more than just a laundry stop. It's a gathering place, a checkpoint in people's days where they know they'll find not just clean clothes, but a friendly face and a moment of dignity.
""Thirty loads a day, sometimes more,"" Phillip says. ""Each one's a story. Each one's someone feeling a bit more human. It's just laundry, but it's not just laundry. It's... it's giving people back a bit of themselves.""
Community leaders and service providers speak highly of Phillip's dedication. They note how his consistent presence has built trust, allowing other services to better reach those in need. His work with Orange Sky has become a cornerstone of community support in Kalgoorlie. Phillip himself is modest about his impact. ""I don't talk much, but I listen,"" he says. ""Every load of washing, every conversation - it's all part of the story here. I'm just helping write a few cleaner pages, I guess.""
But to the people of Kalgoorlie, especially those doing it tough, Phillip and his Orange Sky van represent more than clean laundry. They represent care, consistency, and a small but significant restoration of dignity. In a world that can often feel chaotic and uncaring, Phillip stands as a quiet guardian of humanity, one load of laundry at a time.
As one community elder put it, ""Phillip doesn't just wash clothes. He washes away a bit of the hardship, a bit of the shame. He might not say much, but his work speaks louder than words ever could.""
In the end, it's perhaps Phillip's own words that best sum up the profound simplicity of his mission: ""Some days are hard. Some people are doing it real tough. But then you see someone walk away standing a bit straighter, looking a bit prouder in their clean clothes. That's why I'm here every day.""
And that's why, to the people of Kalgoorlie, Phillip isn't just the Orange Sky operator. He's a vital part of their community, a quiet hero whose impact is felt in every clean shirt, every fresh blanket, and every restored sense of self-worth.","Prevention,Hygiene,Community","Phillip, a Nudju man from Norseman, operates the Orange Sky mobile laundry service in Kalgoorlie.

In fact, I got the job without interview,"" he recalls, highlighting his expertise in inventory control systems and steel automation. His career took him through various companies and government departments, riding the waves of technological change from mainframe computers to the era of broadband and Wi-Fi.
However, life had its twists and turns. Health issues, including heart surgery, forced a change in lifestyle. ""The doctor said work in the open,"" he explains, leading to a significant shift in his daily routine. It's at this juncture that Orange Sky enters his story, providing not just a practical service but a lifeline to community and connection.
Discovering Orange Sky through local community services, our interviewee found a solution to a seemingly simple but challenging task - washing his bedding. ""I got a few bed sheets and pillow covers which I can't normally wash. It takes a lot of struggle to wash it. So they are giving me a chance to wash my big clothes,"" he shares, his gratitude evident in his words.
But Orange Sky offers more than just clean laundry. The fixed schedule and friendly volunteers provide structure and social interaction. ""Very good, very helpful and friendly nature. And they are quite good accommodating,"" he notes, appreciating the chance to chat and connect with others during his visits.
Throughout the conversation, our interviewee weaves in fascinating snippets of his family history, including connections to the Indian Royal family and his great-grandfather's education in England. These stories add depth to his narrative, highlighting the rich tapestry of experiences that immigrants bring to their new homes.
Despite the challenges he's faced, including career changes and health issues, our interviewee's resilience shines through.

""Synergy in Service: St Vincent de Paul and Orange Sky's Collaborative Impact in Mackay""
In the heart of Mackay, a powerful collaboration between St Vincent de Paul and Orange Sky is redefining community support. Richard Calligan, the regional president of St Vincent de Paul, shares insights into this partnership and its impact on the local community.
Richard's journey with Orange Sky began years ago when he first heard about their mobile laundry services. As he stepped into his role as regional president, the partnership between St Vincent de Paul and Orange Sky deepened. ""I became much more aware of the previous regional president. He had provided an opportunity for Orange Sky to use our resources here in terms of a place so they could be a much more stable presence rather than working out the front through a van situation,"" Richard explains.
This collaboration has created a unique synergy, a word Richard struggled to find initially but perfectly encapsulates the relationship. ""It's very... I can't think of the word, but it's very... It's not serendipitous, but it's certainly very helpful,"" he reflects. This synergy manifests in the scheduling of services, with Orange Sky operating on the same days as St Vincent de Paul's family support days.
The impact of this partnership extends beyond just providing clean laundry. Richard emphasizes the dual importance of the practical service and the human connection it fosters. ""It's hard to separate the washing from the conversation,"" he notes. ""What I've learned is that there's a range of reasons why people may need to wash clothes, including the breakdown of your own washing machine. It doesn't mean you're destitute or anything like that. It just means that you need an alternative.""
This understanding highlights the non-judgmental and accessible nature of the services provided. It's not just about addressing extreme need but offering support to anyone in the community who might benefit from it. This approach aligns perfectly with St Vincent de Paul's mission of providing outreach and conversation alongside practical assistance.
Richard also sheds light on the changing needs of the Mackay community. He observes increased demand for support, particularly around Christmas, New Year, and the start of the school year. ""People just need additional support. Maybe some of the money they have can go into rent and other utilities, whereas we can provide relief in terms of giving them some groceries or some grocery vouchers,"" he explains.
Looking to the future, Richard envisions a Mackay that can address its housing and accommodation needs. He sees the potential in the community's wealth and generosity, emphasizing the need for collaboration between government and social groups. ""We are a wealthy community and a generous community. We just need mechanisms and government and other groups within society to all push in the one direction. And be persistent,"" he states.
The partnership between St Vincent de Paul and Orange Sky serves as a model for how different organizations can work together to create a more significant impact. As Richard puts it, ""Orange Sky is a way for people to contribute to the community in a very practical way, and without putting much demands on them."" This accessibility and practicality make it an attractive option for those looking to make a difference.
As Mackay continues to grow and evolve, the collaboration between St Vincent de Paul and Orange Sky stands as a testament to the power of community partnerships. It offers not just clean laundry and groceries, but hope, dignity, and connection to those who need it most. Richard's vision for the future, including plans to convert their current site into accommodation units, promises even greater impact in the years to come.
In Richard's words, ""St Vincent de Paul is grateful for the opportunity to work with Orange Sky and provide service to people in need."" This gratitude, coupled with a commitment to ongoing collaboration, paints a hopeful picture for the future of community support in Mackay and beyond.","Prevention,Education,Impact,Hygiene,Commitment","Richard Calligan, regional president of St Vincent de Paul, highlights the synergy between their work and Orange Sky in providing practical support.",148

In the heart of a community grappling with unseen struggles, Rikki Downman's story unfolds as a testament to the power of individual action and human connection. As a new volunteer with Orange Sky, Rikki's journey illuminates the profound impact that one person's commitment can have on a community in need.
Rikki's involvement with Orange Sky began just six weeks ago, sparked by a urgent Facebook post from a local councillor. ""I saw a post on Facebook from a local councillor saying that the service is at a point where they're desperately needing volunteers and that it would possibly be shut down if they didn't get some more volunteers,"" Rikki recalls. This call to action resonated deeply with her, prompting an immediate response. ""Within a day or so, I'd already signed up. So yeah, within a week I was here.""
This swift decision to volunteer speaks volumes about Rikki's character and her understanding of the community's needs. She recognizes the stigma associated with seeking help, especially in a public setting. ""I think that there is a stigma about, you know, like coming to something like this, being in the community,"" she explains. ""There's a stigma about the fact that we are in the public eye and admitting that you might need a bit of help.""
To combat this stigma, Rikki emphasizes the importance of collaboration with local services. She mentions ongoing discussions with NDIS about bringing their clients to Orange Sky, creating a more comfortable environment for those who might feel ashamed or hesitant to come alone.
What sets Rikki apart is her natural ability to connect with people from all walks of life. ""One of the reasons why I joined is I feel like I have a bit of a knack for just... I have a bit of a knack for talking to people,"" she shares. This skill has already made a significant difference in her short time as a volunteer.
Rikki recounts a powerful story of engaging a hesitant passerby, illustrating the impact of a simple conversation. ""There was a gentleman who was walking along this path just last week and you could see that he was sort of... He kept looking over, but he didn't really want to come over,"" she remembers. By taking the initiative to approach him, Rikki was able to provide not just a meal, but also valuable information about local services and a much-needed human connection.
While Rikki is still new to Orange Sky, she already sees the potential for long-term positive impacts on the friends who use the service. She believes that consistent engagement and support can contribute to an improved sense of wellbeing over time.
For Rikki, volunteering with Orange Sky is about more than just providing laundry services. It's about giving back to the community and spreading awareness. She's taken on the role of advocate, sharing information about Orange Sky with people in her everyday life, from fellow parents at her son's school to strangers on the street.
Her approach to volunteering is refreshingly simple yet profoundly impactful. ""I just love having chats with people you know,"" she explains. ""Some people don't even want to get anything washed but they're walking past and I just love how you going how you been you know what's what are you up to today.""
Rikki Downman's story is a powerful reminder of the difference one person can make in their community. Her journey with Orange Sky, from a Facebook post to frontline volunteer, exemplifies the ripple effect of compassion and engagement. As she continues to connect with friends, recruit new volunteers, and spread awareness, Rikki is not just washing clothes – she's weaving a stronger, more supportive community fabric, one conversation at a time.","Impact,Hygiene,Commitment,Dignity","Rikki Downman, a new Orange Sky volunteer, shares her passion for community service, highlighting the importance of personal connections in overcoming stigma.",158

In the heart of Perth, at a bustling hub called Trambi, Rita and Min are redefining what it means to serve their community through Orange Sky. Their story is one of dedication, human connection, and the profound impact of simple acts of kindness.
Rita, a team leader and service coordinator for Orange Sky at Trambi, has been with the organization for seven years. She's witnessed the evolution of their services, from a mobile van to a fully-equipped internal laundry. ""We've been here for about seven years,"" Rita explains. ""First with the van, which has always been very, very busy. Then Trambi, Uniting WA, our service provider here, actually did a big renovation of the premises, and we're now able to actually use the internal laundry, which is fantastic.""
The Trambi hub is more than just a laundry service. It's a comprehensive support center for those experiencing homelessness, offering everything from Centrelink services to street doctors. Rita's pride in the facility is evident as she describes their operations, emphasizing the efficiency of their wash list system and the dedication of their volunteers.
For Rita, the motivation to volunteer comes from a deep sense of empathy and a desire to give back. ""I think it's fantastic to give something back to people who are less fortunate than we are,"" she shares. ""I go home to a warm house. And I'm like, I'm going to do this. And these people here, these are really people who need all the help they can get.""
The concept of friendship is central to Orange Sky's mission, and Rita's understanding of this is profound. ""These people really mean something to us,"" she explains. Her experiences at Trambi have ranged from joyful successes to heart-wrenching losses, painting a realistic picture of the challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness.
Min, a newer volunteer, brings a fresh perspective to the team. Her journey to Orange Sky was driven by a desire to make a difference after witnessing the increasing homelessness in her city. ""I looked up various organizations, looked at Orange Sky's website. I thought it was very informative, really like the mission, the founders. That just seemed really progressive,"" Min recalls.
For Min, volunteering with Orange Sky has been a humbling and transformative experience. ""It's very humbling, you know, and putting my own, I guess, ego aside and just realizing this can happen to anyone as well,"" she reflects. This realization underscores the non-judgmental approach that Orange Sky volunteers strive to maintain.
Both Rita and Min emphasize the importance of open-mindedness and a willingness to connect with people from all walks of life. They see their role not just as service providers, but as friends and confidants to those who often feel invisible in society.
The impact of their work extends beyond clean laundry. It's about restoring dignity, providing a listening ear, and offering hope. Rita shares a success story of a friend who found employment and housing, illustrating the potential for positive change that their support can facilitate.
For those considering volunteering, Min's advice is simple: ""Just give it a go."" She emphasizes the flexibility of the commitment and the personal rewards that come from serving others.
Rita and Min's story at Trambi is a powerful testament to the impact of community service. Through their dedication and compassion, they're not just washing clothes – they're weaving a stronger, more supportive community fabric. Their experiences highlight the transformative power of human connection and the profound difference that volunteers can make in the lives of those experiencing homelessness.

In the bustling city of Perth, Samuel Thornberry's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the transformative impact of volunteering. As an IT professional by day and an Orange Sky volunteer by choice, Samuel's journey illustrates how simple acts of kindness can bridge the gap between diverse life experiences and foster a deeper understanding of community needs.
Samuel's introduction to Orange Sky came through a serendipitous Instagram post. What caught his attention wasn't just the opportunity to volunteer, but the profound simplicity of Orange Sky's mission. ""I like the idea of, it's such a simple idea but really powerful. Giving dignity to people,"" Samuel explains. This concept of restoring dignity through something as basic as clean laundry struck a chord with him, opening his eyes to an aspect of homelessness he had never considered before.
As Samuel delved into his volunteer work, his perceptions of homelessness began to shift dramatically. ""You don't realize how widespread it is. Like, it affects people from sort of all different walks of life,"" he reflects. The diverse backgrounds of the friends he met through Orange Sky challenged his preconceptions, highlighting the complex and varied paths that can lead to homelessness.
One of the most striking aspects of Samuel's experience has been the power of human connection. He recounts a particularly moving interaction: ""One of the first weeks volunteering was someone was talking about having a bit of a chat like a lot of people ignore him when he's on the street... He was talking about how he just yeah like empowered the dignity and um just felt a bit more humanized having been able to have a chat with us."" This encounter underscores the profound impact that simple acts of acknowledgment and conversation can have on those experiencing homelessness.
For Samuel, volunteering with Orange Sky provides a meaningful counterbalance to his professional life. As an IT professional, much of his workday is spent behind a desk, with limited human interaction. Orange Sky offers him an opportunity to develop his people skills and engage in meaningful conversations. ""Something like this it's just great like be able to build people skills get to chat to them um I really like that human connection something always we're really drawn to,"" he shares.
The concept of friendship is central to Orange Sky's mission, and Samuel's reflections on this theme are particularly poignant. ""Your mates are there for you um and the good times and the bad um I think until you go through a bad time sometimes you don't realize how important it is to have a really strong support network,"" he observes. This understanding of friendship's value extends to his interactions with Orange Sky's friends, emphasizing the importance of building relationships and providing a support network for those who may feel isolated.
Looking to the future, Samuel expresses a desire for earlier intervention in mental health issues to prevent homelessness. His experiences have shown him how mental health can deteriorate over time, leading to rough sleeping and further challenges. This insight speaks to the broader societal issues surrounding homelessness and the need for comprehensive support systems.

In the heart of the Central Coast, Steve Sutton's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the impact of volunteering in retirement. After 36 years in finance and business banking, Steve found himself at a crossroads, seeking a meaningful way to spend his newfound free time. His journey with Orange Sky not only filled that void but also opened his eyes to the realities of homelessness in his community.
Steve's introduction to Orange Sky came through a Facebook ad, piquing his interest in October of the previous year. ""I thought that looks pretty interesting. Wouldn't mind giving that a crack, see what it's like,"" he recalls. This curiosity led him to embark on a journey that would challenge his perceptions and enrich his retirement years.
Initially, Steve's experience with Orange Sky was quiet, with few friends using the service. However, a pivotal moment came when the local neighborhood center relocated near their operations. ""It's been really good. So a lot of people have come to get, you know, support, food support, hampers. You know, talk to people about trying to get accommodation and then it just sort of picked up from there,"" Steve explains. This increase in activity highlighted the vital role Orange Sky plays in the community.
One of the most striking aspects of Steve's experience has been the shift in his understanding of homelessness. ""I would say I was probably unaware of how many people are homeless,"" he reflects. Through his shifts in various locations, Steve has encountered a diverse range of individuals experiencing homelessness, challenging his preconceptions. ""You sort of just wonder why are you living out of a van. So, you know, sometimes you think but for the grace of God go I,"" he shares, illustrating the profound impact these interactions have had on his perspective.
Steve emphasizes the importance of Orange Sky's laundry services, noting how it fills a crucial need for those who can't afford or access laundry facilities. But beyond the practical service, he highlights the human connection aspect. ""The friends are really, really grateful and will come up to you quite often and say, look thanks, we really appreciate what you do,"" Steve says, underscoring the emotional impact of the service.
As a van leader, Steve has taken on additional responsibilities, despite his self-proclaimed lack of mechanical expertise. His willingness to ""give it a go"" exemplifies the spirit of volunteerism that drives Orange Sky. ""I come from finance. I've got no mechanical background at all... But no, look, the support's pretty good,"" he shares, highlighting the comprehensive training and support Orange Sky provides to its volunteers.
Steve's insights into the broader issues surrounding homelessness are particularly poignant. He recognizes the urgent need for affordable housing, especially in the face of rising property prices on the Central Coast. ""What's needed is obviously more affordable accommodation... but there needs to be more money into, you know, affordable housing for people,"" he asserts, touching on a critical issue facing many communities.
The collaborative nature of Orange Sky's work with other service providers and local government is something Steve particularly appreciates. ""I like what they do here. I think working in partnership with the local government, I think it's a really important thing,"" he notes, emphasizing the power of a united approach to addressing homelessness.
For Steve, the rewards of volunteering are multifaceted. The gratitude of friends, the camaraderie among volunteers, and the personal satisfaction of making a difference all contribute to his continued commitment. ""I just get a bit of a kick out of doing it, I think,"" he says, encapsulating the fulfillment many volunteers find in their service.
As Orange Sky celebrates its 10th anniversary, Steve's journey from finance professional to dedicated volunteer serves as a powerful example of the impact one person can have in retirement.

Her journey, rooted in family tradition and a deep sense of social responsibility, offers profound insights into the power of volunteerism and the importance of restoring dignity to those in need.
Suzanne's involvement in this vital community service stems from a rich family history of religious service.

This background, coupled with her education at the local grammar school, laid the foundation for her commitment to serving others.

This dual purpose of nourishing both body and soul underscores the profound impact of their work.
The diversity of those served is striking. From homeless individuals sleeping in the cathedral doorways to impoverished families, lonely individuals seeking connection, and those recently released from jail or rehabilitation, the meal service caters to a wide spectrum of community needs. This inclusivity reflects the program's commitment to serving all who are in need, regardless of their circumstances.
A unique aspect of the program is the involvement of grammar school students in serving meals and washing up. Suzanne sees this as a crucial learning experience: ""It's very important to be with the young people because, number one, it's a learning experience because some of them wouldn't realise that people aren't as fortunate as they are. And secondly, they're the future carers."" This intergenerational approach not only provides practical help but also cultivates empathy and social responsibility in the younger generation.
The partnership with Orange Sky adds another dimension to the service provided. Suzanne enthusiastically endorses this collaboration: ""It's invaluable because it's giving them the dignity that they can actually, you know, have clean clothes, et cetera."" The synergy between providing a meal and offering laundry services exemplifies a holistic approach to meeting the needs of those experiencing homelessness or hardship.
The longevity and sustainability of the program are impressive, with this year marking its 40th anniversary. Suzanne attributes this success to the dedicated team of volunteers and the roster system they've implemented. ""Everything's completely voluntary,"" she explains. ""We have people on the roster. Now, some of them, for example, are on dessert, so they turned up... the cheesecakes. And some were on the roast part, so they might have had chicken or beef or lamb."" This division of responsibilities ensures the smooth running of the service without incurring costs for the parish.
While the primary focus is on providing meals and fostering social connections, Suzanne and her team are also attuned to other needs their guests might have. They maintain resources for emergency housing and can refer individuals to the Samaritans for additional support, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to community care.
Suzanne's story is a powerful testament to the impact of sustained community service. Her decade-long commitment, rooted in personal history and fueled by compassion, has touched countless lives. As she continues to serve alongside her team of volunteers, Suzanne embodies the spirit of community care, showing how simple acts of kindness can restore dignity, foster connections, and make a lasting difference in people's lives.","Prevention,Education,Impact,Hygiene,Commitment","Suzanne shares her decade-long journey serving meals to the homeless at Christchurch Cathedral, highlighting community service, youth involvement.",146

In the heart of Australia, Terina Ahone-Masafi's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the impact of compassionate community services and the enduring human need for connection. At 29 years old, Terina's journey as an immigrant and her experience with homelessness highlight the crucial role organizations like Orange Sky and Trambi play in providing not just practical support, but also dignity and friendship to those facing challenging circumstances.
Terina's story begins with her arrival in Australia at the age of 17. Now, after 11 years in the country, she finds herself navigating the complexities of homelessness. Despite these challenges, Terina's spirit remains unbroken, fueled by her passions for art, music, and athletics. Her resilience shines through as she shares her experiences with Orange Sky and Trambi.
""I really love their customer service, I love how they treat people and I just really love how they're very welcoming and professional,"" Terina says of Orange Sky. This sentiment underscores the importance of treating individuals experiencing homelessness with respect and dignity. For Terina, it's not just about accessing necessary services; it's about being seen and valued as a person.
Terina's journey to Trambi began when she needed to move from a couchsurfing situation. ""I got told about Trambi a while ago but then I came here one day on the 25th of June and yeah, so I found out about Trambi, started to realise you can have showers here and that's how it all started,"" she explains. This highlights the critical role that information and access to services play in supporting those experiencing homelessness.
When asked about the meaning of friendship, Terina's response is profound in its simplicity: ""Connection. Having a good connection, you know. You know, knowing, getting to know one another, each other's positives and negatives and being there for one another, yeah."" This definition speaks volumes about the human need for genuine relationships, especially during challenging times.
Terina's appreciation for the staff and volunteers at Orange Sky and Trambi goes beyond their professional demeanor. ""Very welcoming, professional and they're very interesting to talk to because they've got a lot to say,"" she notes. This comment highlights the importance of social interaction and engaging conversations in maintaining a sense of normalcy and connection for those experiencing homelessness.
Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the multifaceted nature of homelessness. Terina's background as an immigrant, her personal interests, and her positive outlook despite difficult circumstances paint a picture of a complex individual facing challenging times. It challenges stereotypes about homelessness and underscores the importance of personalized, compassionate support.
Organizations like Orange Sky and Trambi, through their welcoming atmosphere and professional approach, are doing more than providing practical services. They are restoring dignity, fostering connections, and helping individuals like Terina maintain hope and resilience in the face of adversity.
Terina's journey with Orange Sky and Trambi is a testament to the power of community support and the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their circumstances. It reminds us that behind every person experiencing homelessness is a unique story, filled with challenges, hopes, and the universal human need for connection.
As we reflect on Terina's story, we're reminded of the crucial role that compassionate community services play in supporting vulnerable individuals. It challenges us to consider how we can contribute to creating a more inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their housing status, feels valued, connected, and supported.","Impact,Hygiene,Commitment,Homelessness,Transformation","Terina Ahone-Masafi, a 29-year-old immigrant experiencing homelessness, shares her appreciation for Orange Sky's services and the importance of connection.",155

In the heart of Newcastle, at Christchurch Cathedral, Tom Bowyer's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the transformative impact of community service. What began as a mother's nudge during the COVID-19 pandemic has blossomed into a passionate commitment to serving those in need and inspiring the next generation of volunteers.
Tom's journey into community service started with a simple directive from his mother, the Dean of Christchurch Cathedral. ""The honest answer is my mum told me,"" Tom admits with a smile. ""During COVID she, when everything was shut down and when radiuses were happening, she said, you need to go over there and do it."" This initial push led to an unexpected love affair with community service that has now spanned six years.
The fortnightly community lunch program at Christchurch Cathedral, a 40-year-old initiative, serves as a beacon of hope for those ""doing it rough"" in the community. Tom's description of the atmosphere during these lunches paints a vivid picture of community in action. ""It just feels so great. It's seeing people come back and, you know, sit down and have a nice meal and they're talking with each other. They're sharing their stories,"" he shares.
One of the most striking aspects of Tom's experience is the program's role in providing not just food, but a sense of safety and community. ""We get people bringing their, some guests will bring their kids here,"" Tom notes. ""And on one level, it's a bit heartbreaking because you don't want to see kids grow up with that sort of hardship. But another level, I sort of feel sort of a bit warm about it and go, we are that safe place.""
The collaboration with Orange Sky has added a new dimension to the services provided. Tom enthusiastically describes this partnership as filling ""a missing piece,"" allowing them to offer not just food, but also clean clothes and meaningful conversation. This holistic approach to service underscores the program's commitment to restoring dignity to those they serve.
Perhaps one of the most impactful aspects of the program is its focus on youth engagement. Through partnerships with Newcastle Grammar School and the Newcastle Wanderers Rugby Club, young people are given the opportunity to experience the rewards of community service firsthand. Tom sees this as crucial in developing a sense of social justice in the next generation. ""I think being, having that sense of volunteering, community volunteering instilled in you when you're young age,"" he reflects, drawing on his own experiences as a high school student volunteering with his mother.
Tom's passion for service is evident in his commitment to showing up, regardless of the number of volunteers available. ""We have however many kids we have. We've done it with two kids. We've done it with 20 kids,"" he explains, highlighting the program's resilience and dedication.
As Tom continues to serve and inspire others through his work at Christchurch Cathedral, his story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact one person can have when they choose to give back to their community. His journey from a reluctant volunteer to a passionate advocate for community service illustrates the transformative power of stepping out of one's comfort zone to help others.
In a world that often feels disconnected, Tom Bowyer and the community lunch program at Christchurch Cathedral stand as beacons of hope, reminding us of the profound impact that simple acts of kindness and service can have on both individuals and communities. As Tom so eloquently puts it, ""If people like us don't do it, then no one else will."" It's a call to action that resonates far beyond the walls of Christchurch Cathedral, challenging us all to find our own ways to give back and make a difference in our communities.","Prevention,Education,Impact,Hygiene,Commitment","Tom Bowyer, a dedicated volunteer at Christchurch Cathedral's community lunch program, shares his passion for service and the impact of youth involvement.",154

In the bustling coastal town of Newcastle, Tom Robinson's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the transformative power of community service and human connection. At 39, Tom's journey from a corporate career to studying social work and volunteering with Orange Sky offers profound insights into the value of giving back and the unexpected rewards of stepping out of one's comfort zone.
Tom's path to Orange Sky began with a simple suggestion from his mother and a desire to fill his spare time meaningfully. ""I was looking for a charity to work for and give some time for and my mum said she'd heard of Orange Sky,"" Tom recalls. This initial curiosity has blossomed into a deep commitment, with Tom now serving as a team leader for the Thursday shift.
For Tom, the transition from corporate life to social work and volunteering represents a quest for fulfillment. ""I've worked corporate for the majority of my life... but ultimately it wasn't kind of filling up that cup of helping people and being a productive member of society,"" he explains. This shift in focus highlights a growing trend of individuals seeking more meaningful ways to contribute to their communities.
Tom's experience with Orange Sky has profoundly impacted his understanding of community needs and the power of human connection. He describes Orange Sky as ""a space holder"" and ""a bastion of connection"" for people who often feel unseen or disconnected. ""A lot of people live by themselves and they don't get a lot of outward free time,"" Tom notes, emphasizing the importance of the social interactions that Orange Sky facilitates.
One of the most striking aspects of Tom's experience is his evolving perception of homelessness and vulnerability. ""One of the perceptions that's changed is just how easy it is for you to find yourself in a situation where you need help,"" he reflects. This realization underscores the importance of empathy and non-judgmental support in community service.
As a social work student, Tom recognizes the invaluable learning experience that volunteering provides. He sees the power of lived experience in community work, describing it as a ""superpower"" that allows volunteers to better understand and support those they serve. This perspective highlights the reciprocal nature of volunteering, where both the volunteer and the person being served benefit from the interaction.
Tom's insights into the mental health benefits of volunteering are particularly poignant. ""It's really good for my mental health,"" he shares. ""You know, I get like anxiety, depression and stuff. And this helps to serve a purpose."" This candid acknowledgment of personal struggles and the therapeutic value of service speaks to the holistic benefits of community engagement.
The interview also touches on broader societal issues, such as the impact of technology on human connection and the challenges of maintaining focus in a distracted world. Tom's reflections on these topics demonstrate the depth of thought that volunteering can inspire, encouraging a more nuanced understanding of social issues.
As Tom continues his journey with Orange Sky and his studies in social work, his story serves as an inspiration for others considering a shift towards more meaningful community engagement. His experience demonstrates that volunteering is not just about giving time, but about building connections, gaining new perspectives, and finding personal fulfillment through service to others.

In the heart of Kalgoorlie, a mining town on the edge of the Western Australian desert, Tracey McCartney's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the impact of grassroots community service. What began as a simple act of kindness - offering a cup of tea to those in need - has blossomed into M25, a comprehensive support hub that's changing lives and restoring dignity to the area's most vulnerable residents.
Tracey's journey with M25 began almost by accident. As the secretary at the Church of Christ for about 20 years, she found herself responding to the immediate needs of people who came to the church's new location. ""When we moved location, we moved to Kalgoorlie. To the new location at Lane Street, we had some people coming in asking for a cup of tea and so I made them a cup of tea,"" Tracey recalls. This simple act of hospitality quickly evolved as she recognized and responded to more needs. ""Then I thought I'll get some fresh clothes. I'll get a towel. And so things just kind of snowballed to what we've got today.""
Today, M25 is a bustling hub of activity, offering a range of services to the local homeless population and Indigenous people from surrounding communities. Tracey describes a typical morning: ""People know that we open at 8 o'clock. People are waiting outside. They usually wake up from sleeping. Most of them are homeless. So they will wake up at daybreak from where they've been sleeping on the street and be ready to come here for a shower and breakfast.""
The collaboration with Orange Sky has been a game-changer for M25. Tracey's eyes light up as she discusses the impact of the laundry services. ""When I hear the statistics that come back from Phillip from the washing and the amount of showers that we do as well, because you're kind of just busy on the ground with people coming and going and that. And you don't really appreciate the actual numbers,"" she shares. The ability to provide clean clothes and bedding has had far-reaching effects, even improving health outcomes. ""I've had feedback you know people have um doctors at the hospital and nurses have said you know since these services have been introduced that they see people coming in getting treated are are cleaner.""
One of the most striking aspects of Tracey's approach is her emphasis on building relationships and creating a sense of family. She doesn't see her work at M25 as a job, but rather as a place to meet with friends. This perspective is particularly evident in her interactions with the children who frequent the center. ""Some of them we've known like since our babies since they you know since they come along so it for me it's like you know a bit more than it's like I was saying before it's not like work it's a bit more like family,"" Tracey explains.
The location of M25 in Kalgoorlie, on the edge of the desert and near several Indigenous communities, provides unique opportunities and challenges. Tracey sees this as a blessing, allowing them to engage with and learn from a diverse range of people who might not have access to such services in more urban environments.
Looking to the future, Tracey hopes to see M25 continue to grow and adapt to meet the increasing needs of the community. She's particularly excited about the possibility of installing permanent Orange Sky pods, which would allow for even more efficient laundry services.
Tracey McCartney's story is a powerful reminder of the impact that one person's compassion and dedication can have on an entire community.

In the bustling heart of Perth, Vicky Sorenson's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the impact of community service and the transformative power of human connection. Recently retired from a hectic professional role, Vicky has embraced a new chapter in her life, dedicating her time and energy to supporting those experiencing homelessness through her work at Trambi House.
Vicky's journey into community service began long before her retirement. ""I've always been fairly community minded,"" she reflects. Her involvement with organizations like Food Bank and Orange Sky laid the foundation for her current role at Trambi House. This transition from a professional career to full-time volunteering highlights the potential for retirees to make significant contributions to their communities.
At Trambi House, Vicky has found her niche in what she calls ""the cold face"" of community service. ""It's where it's happening,"" she explains. ""Get the basics right. Tummy, food in your tummy, your laundry done, you know, some conversation."" This focus on fundamental needs underscores the importance of addressing the immediate challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness.
However, Vicky's approach goes beyond just meeting basic needs. She emphasizes the crucial role of human connection in her work. ""We all need to feel some sort of connection, don't we?"" she asks. ""And a friend can take on all sorts of things."" This perspective aligns perfectly with Orange Sky's concept of 'friends' - treating those they serve with dignity and respect.
Vicky sees her role at Trambi House through the lens of hospitality. ""I see my role with Trambie House as a hospitality side of it. So hospitality comes with a smile and being welcoming and inclusive,"" she shares. This approach creates an environment where people feel valued and respected, regardless of their circumstances.
The collaborative nature of services at Trambi House is something Vicky particularly appreciates. From street vets to street doctors and lawyers, the facility offers a comprehensive range of support. Vicky notes the importance of effective communication and regular team meetings to ensure the best possible outcomes for those they serve.
For Vicky, the transition from her professional career to full-time volunteering has been a natural progression. ""I couldn't imagine not ever doing it,"" she says of her work at Trambi House. This sentiment speaks to the fulfillment many retirees find in dedicating their time to community service.
Vicky's story also highlights the power of grassroots initiatives in addressing social issues. ""We can't rely on the government. We can't say it's everyone else's problem,"" she asserts. ""We've actually got to get out there, boots on the ground."" This call to action emphasizes the role each individual can play in creating positive change in their community.
The impact of simple acts of kindness is evident in the stories Vicky shares. She recounts a particularly poignant moment from her time with Orange Sky: ""A gentleman said, you know, I finally felt that I could sit on a bus because my clothes were so tight. My clothes were clean and people weren't going to be offended."" This anecdote powerfully illustrates how basic services can restore dignity and self-esteem to those experiencing homelessness.
As Vicky continues her journey of service at Trambi House, her story serves as an inspiration for others, particularly retirees, to consider how they can contribute to their communities. Her experience demonstrates that volunteering not only benefits those being served but also provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment for the volunteers themselves.

In the heart of the Central Coast, Wayne Tate's story unfolds as a powerful testament to the unpredictable nature of life and the crucial role of community services like Orange Sky in supporting those experiencing homelessness. At 47, Wayne's journey from a successful pharmaceutical manufacturer to living in a camper van illustrates how quickly circumstances can change and the importance of maintaining dignity in the face of adversity.
Wayne's background is far from what many might expect of someone experiencing homelessness. ""I went to university, pharmaceutical manufacturer. I worked as a chemist here in Wyland Plaza for 15 years,"" he shares. This stark contrast between his past and present underscores the reality that homelessness can affect anyone, regardless of their education or professional background.
For Wayne, one of the most challenging aspects of his current situation is maintaining his self-esteem and personal appearance. ""I try and dress fresh, you know what I mean? I try and be clean,"" he explains. This is where Orange Sky's services become invaluable. ""If it wasn't for the Orange Sky service, I wouldn't have the clean clothes to whack on every day. You know, I can walk amongst the supermarket, and not look like that homeless person if there's such a stigma, you know.""
The impact of Orange Sky's services goes beyond just clean laundry. For Wayne, it's about maintaining a sense of normalcy and dignity. ""I miss having a home, I miss doing that home procedure sort of thing. So I come here on a Tuesday, Catootlie neighbourhood on a Friday,"" he shares. This routine provides a structure to his week and a connection to the community that he might otherwise lose.
Wayne's appreciation for the Orange Sky volunteers is evident throughout the interview. ""The ladies are amazing. Everything. They let me fold, me washing. Everyone's told me that I fold it better than they do,"" he says with pride. This small act of folding his own laundry gives Wayne a sense of control and purpose in a situation where much feels out of his control.
Despite his own struggles, Wayne demonstrates a remarkable empathy for others in similar or worse situations. ""There's people worse. There's a lot of people worse off. There's so much worse off in my position. I'm lucky to have that camper van,"" he reflects. This perspective highlights the diverse spectrum of homelessness and the importance of tailored support services.
Wayne's story also sheds light on the financial challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness. With only $200 left after paying for his camper van, and most of that going to fuel to access services, Wayne's situation illustrates the daily financial juggling act many face. ""Without these kind of services, I don't, I dare say my depression would have taken over and I probably wouldn't even be here sitting and talking,"" he admits, underscoring the life-saving nature of community support services.
Looking to the future, Wayne expresses a desire to give back. ""I want to volunteer. I've got a volunteers check. When I find a home, I'd love to do some Orange Sky work,"" he shares. This aspiration to help others once his situation improves demonstrates the positive impact Orange Sky has had on his life and his desire to pay it forward.
Wayne's story is a powerful reminder of the importance of community services like Orange Sky in maintaining the dignity and self-worth of those experiencing homelessness. It challenges stereotypes about who can become homeless and highlights the crucial role of human connection and non-judgmental support in helping individuals navigate difficult times.
As Wayne puts it, ""If you see somebody that's homeless, you say hello. If you see someone that's in the same position, you make them feel like there's a conversation so you can have that vent or you can rub with the world and you still are worthy of something."" His words serve as a call to action for all of us to approach those experiencing homelessness with compassion and respect, recognizing their humanity and worth beyond their current circumstances.","Education,Impact,Hygiene,Commitment,Homelessness,Outreach","Wayne Tate, a formerly successful professional now experiencing homelessness, shares his journey and the vital role Orange Sky plays in maintaining his dignity.",160

In the coastal town of Mackay, a remarkable story of youth engagement and community service unfolds through the eyes of William Radke, a grade 12 student and school captain at St. Patrick's College. William's involvement with Orange Sky's breakfast van initiative offers a powerful glimpse into the transformative impact of youth volunteering and the importance of bridging classroom learning with real-world experiences.
William's journey with Orange Sky began as a school initiative, but it has grown into a passion that exemplifies the organization's core values of connection, positivity, and respect. ""It was just an initiative through the school. We started the brekkie van a few years ago. We'd just come down to Orange Sky,"" William explains. This simple start has blossomed into a meaningful engagement that goes far beyond mere community service hours.
The breakfast van initiative operates like a well-oiled machine, with students arriving at 6 am to prepare food for Orange Sky's friends. ""We cook breakfast, the snags and some eggs while they wash their clothes, while it's drying. We cook them and then we have a conversation, which is really important,"" William shares. This routine underscores the dual purpose of Orange Sky's services - meeting immediate practical needs while fostering human connection.
For William, the most crucial aspect of the Orange Sky experience is the conversations that take place. ""I think the conversation is the most important thing because, yes, the washing and the food is very important. But it's the conversations. It's the cathartic experience, getting to talk to people. It's giving advice. We hear some amazing stories,"" he reflects. This emphasis on human connection aligns perfectly with Orange Sky's mission to positively connect communities.
The impact of these interactions extends far beyond the immediate service provided. William recognizes the profound learning opportunity these experiences offer: ""As a student, you learn a lot. And it goes both ways. Everyone benefits from it."" This mutual exchange of stories, perspectives, and experiences creates a rich learning environment that no textbook could replicate.
William's insights highlight the importance of practical, community-based learning experiences for students. ""There's no point just knowing the numbers in the book. It's about talking to people one on one. It's about looking people in the eye and saying stuff that matters,"" he asserts. This hands-on approach to learning and community engagement prepares students for the realities of life beyond the classroom.
Looking to the future, William expresses hope that the impact of these experiences will extend far beyond high school. ""I think many students after leaving school will continue to volunteer in groups like Orange Sky, where we can all help the wider community,"" he predicts. This long-term vision speaks to the lasting impact of youth engagement in community service initiatives.
William's story serves as a powerful reminder of the potential for young people to make a significant difference in their communities. His enthusiasm for the Orange Sky initiative, coupled with his recognition of its importance, offers a blueprint for how schools and community organizations can work together to create meaningful learning experiences and foster a spirit of service among youth.
As Orange Sky continues to expand its reach and impact, stories like William's highlight the crucial role that young volunteers play in the organization's success. By engaging youth in meaningful service opportunities, Orange Sky is not only meeting immediate needs but also cultivating the next generation of compassionate, community-minded citizens.","Education,Impact,Hygiene,Commitment","William Radke, a St. Patrick's College student, shares his experience volunteering with Orange Sky, highlighting the importance of community engagement.",152
